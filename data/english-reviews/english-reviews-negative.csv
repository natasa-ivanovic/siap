-1|I've stayed at this property a few times in San Diego. While the doors do not properly fit and the rooms are not the cleanest it was more out of convenience than anything. Three weeks ago I stayed at this property and they charged me for an extra night. I gave them weeks to respond. I have given the management at this hotel and the accounting weeks to respond but they haven't even tried. I've left emails, voice mails, and one person in accounting said they would get back to me. I have now wasted hours on this issue.
-1|I booked site unseen as I am a Best Western Rewards member. This hotel is older than the seven seas! The outside is old and needs maintenance, appearing more like a highway side trucker motel than a hotel. Rooms are old and musty, with water and moisture damage radiating from the bottom of the exterior door and bathroom door. I know it's moist in San Diego, but doesn't necessarily mean the room should smell moldy. Room appeared clean at first glance, but tile floor in shower/toilet area needed scrubbing and vanity looked like it was never dusted. Shower water was luke warm.,
-1|I checked out and moved to another Best Western in town right after I checked in to this hotel. Checking in experience was very bad, desk clerk was poorly trained. I was assigned to room 159. It was a non-smk room, but has a big ashtray installed right on the wall outside the room door. The room smells so bad, they sprayed so much air fresher trying to cover the smell from odor smoking but made it worse. I found so many hairs on the bed sheet, there's a big area of yellow stains on the sheet as well, I wonder if they change the sheets after each check out or not. I went to the desk checked out, they charged me for the night anyways, without any apologize. I left my phone number for the manager to call me back, one week past, they never call me back. I gave them more than enough chance to solve the problem, but I guess they rather prefer me to share my experience with the public.So, if you don't care about the cleanness, don't care about the service, don't care get you and your family sick, don't care about they will ruin your vacation, go ahead book your room at this hotel!!
-1|The room was ok. I stayed there from Friday to Monday. We couldn't even get a late check out. Check out was at 12. And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.
-1|This hotel in on Hotel Circle not far tho old san diego, but really near from highways. The room was cleam, but really small. There is a restaurant and a free access to Internet. Cheap, but you could maybe find something more interestinf near the ocean. You could maybe have a few difficulties to park your car (there aren't many places in the area. Here, you will see only the cars...,
-1|The freezing pool. The broken jacuzzi. The unfriendly staff. The rattley old refrigerator in the room. The only cheapest harsh bright white lights used, no night lights. We could hear everyone above and beside us, so the construction of this place is very poor.
-1|I basically live out of hotels and this is the WORST I have ever seen. Staring with parking you are paying 12.00 for a spot that you have to do a 3 point turn to get into and my Camry almost didnt fit into. The room was super small for being a family suite and everything was cramped. The was enough space between the foot of the bed and the tv table was wide enough for a vacuum to fit though as well as the space between the bed and the wall. The second room was divided by a French door only the fixed side of the French door had window covering so there is no privacy between rooms and the lights from either room shines into each other. The AC was weak and smelt like mold. The second room never got air and by the time you go to the bathroom forget it just open the window to let the air in. There is no circulation, except what was provided by a large fan in the wall between rooms that was extremely loud and reminded me of an attic fan. One good thing the bed was comfortable for a single night stay. This location does offer breakfast, but after making a waffle and getting a plate together and sitting down to eat each of us took a bite and ended up at Dennys down the street. I wasnt expecting a Hilton or the Ritz Carlton, but I was expecting something a little higher than what ended up looking like highway motel. Lucky for us we were there only one night before heading home to Los Angeles.
-1|We stayed at this hotel last year for 10 nights and while the rooms weren't completely up to date, it was clean, had extra room, breakfast was decent, and for the price we felt we got a great deal. Based on our past experience, we booked again for a family reunion and referred our family to also book this hotel. We arrived late at night and check in was fine. The lobby still looked nice and the elevator was still slow like we remembered. The first thing we noticed when we got to our room and turned the bed down were the yellow stains on the sheets. At this point I wasn't sure if the sheets had been laundered and they were permanent stains, or if the sheets had not been changed. I called the front desk and they had me come get a new set of sheets. By the time I got back up to the room, my husband had discovered the towels hanging in the bathroom had fresh lipstick/makeup all over them. I went back to talk to the front desk and the employee decided it was time to try a different room. Room 2 had a ant on top of the pillows on the bed and when we turned down the bed and pulled the pillows away from the headboard out ran 10 more. Back to the front desk we went and were now headed off to room 3. When opening the door to Room 3 we were immediately hit with what I can only describe as B.O. and it was potent. I called the front desk and told them about the smell and told them we would tough it out for the night as it was getting super late and we had a baby with us. I asked when the manager would be in the next day and was told 10 a.m. I ran the air vent on the airconditioner and also turned on the bathroom exhaust fan all night. The next morning the smell was as bad as ever. It literally was oozing out of everything in the room-the mattress, the couch. There were ants in this room also, but they were crawling on the wall instead of instead of in the bed. I headed down to visit with the manager of the hotel and found he was out due to an emergency. I expressed my concerns to the staff that was there (the housekeeping supervisor and a young gentleman) and asked to cancel the rest of my stay as well as the reservations for my family that would be arriving in town later in the week. The housekeeping supervisor came up to the room and acknowledged the smell and thought that it was possibly wet carpet-my opinion was that the room smelled due to body odor and not cleaning the room thoroughly. The only rooms the hotel had left were double rooms and she offered to let me walk through one before moving all of my belongings again, but I declined as we had already switched rooms 3 times and I also was very concerned about how many times my family coming into town would have to switch rooms to find an acceptable one.This hotel has drastically gone down hill in cleanliness since we stayed here last year. The linens in all of the rooms were stained and the towels were threadbare and grey. There were ants in 2 of the 3 rooms we checked into that night. I felt this hotel was along the lines of a motel 6 at best. Free breakfast cannot make up for a filthy hotel that is not being cleaned properly. We actually witnessed a maid RUNNING into and out of a room in less than 5 minutes. How do you clean a room that fast And we certainly didn't see a vacuum. We were wondering if the maids were paid by the room and not the hour. I do want to say the front desk staff was very accommodating and tried their hardest to find an acceptable room and I appreciate that they were willing to cancel our reservations when they realized their hotel had too many issues. ****PLEASE HIRE A SUPERVISOR FOR YOUR MAIDS AND INVEST IN REPL.ACING OLD/STAINED LINENS AND TOWELS***
-1|We stayed here on October 9-12 and the entire weekend the ice machines and soda machine on our floor was out of order. I did not check the other floors' soda machines. The parking was 12 a night and very tight for out Yukon XL. The breakfast was good and the beds were comfortable.
-1|The only thing nice that we saw here was the pool, which looked clean and fresh (unfortunately, I didn't bring a suit). The place has very, very old and beat up furniture and was either too hot or too cold -- the heating systems are terrible, built under the window as in older cheap properties and then the beds are behind some sliding doors, so you have to leave those doors open if you want any cooling. The breakfast in the morning is really disgusting. They seem to have people making the breakfast who know nothing about what coffee is supposed to look like, for example, or what bacon strips look like. They had a whole container full of picnic bacon, which is just scraps of pork in no particular shape, generally used as bacon pieces for other foods. And here it is in their hot breakfast like you are supposed to dive in and just eat those bacon scraps as if they are slices of morning bacon. Not me!The coffee maker in the room saved the day for us, because it was actually much better than expected. In a general sense, this room was not the quality that we expected for what we paid, and we were generally disappointed. Complicating the situation, we asked for a wake up call at 10:06 PM one night, and they promised to call. We were never awakened and it caused some big problems. I hope the attached photos help people understand why they should avoid this property.,
-1|This hotel is just ok. The rooms are decent but nothing more. The pool is small but I guess adaquate for kids. The walls are paper thin and we were awake every night by people walking in the room above. If you want quiet choose a room on the 3rd floor and away from the pool. The complimentary breakfast is just ok also. I love my breakfast and this was not that good at all. Eggs and sausages were not edible. At least there was cereal and milk. The location is good as there are several big shopping malls around. The zoo and sea world are close also. Ralph's grocery store is also not far. You do need a car in san diego though.
-1|Nice lush landscaping, nice pool. Close to freeways and gas station. Stayed in room 315. The kids liked having their own space. Hard to take a shower, no or low pressure. Air conditioner didn't seem to be working. I called front desk, girl said they hadn't had any complaints! Seriously I'm calling! Was so hot for 3 nights! There was a stand up fan so I assumed they knew the AC wasn't working. Breakfast was blah. Make sure you have time because the breakfast area was packed and they take FOREVER to replenish the hot foods. Overall, my stay was fine. Kids were happy.,
-1|Towels are yellow and gray, wallpaper is dirty and marked, room is musty and smelly, carpet looks 30 years old, furniture is mismatched, scuffed, phones are old, the building is old and falling apart. The only nice area was the lobby.,
-1|First, make sure you are booking the hotel you want. There is another Comfort Inn (Zoo / SeaWorld area) nearby and it has a better rating than this one. At this one we reserved a kid's suite, however, they do not seem to have a room as pictured on the website w/kid's bunkbed. So you buy a room and get another one that is dirty and smells bad. The staff at the reception is courteous, but the cleaning people seem to make a special effort to make you feel uncomfortable.,
-1|My family and I checked in on Thursday 9/21 around 9pm. The parking lot was very small and hard to get a spot. When we finally got in the lobby, it looked clean and presentable. Our room was an entirely different story. It was facing outside by the pool. The light was already on in our room before we entered. Once we got in I was immediately disgusted. It smelled horrible (almost like a really bad sulfur), room looked very outdated and unappealing. Room was small, beds were old and I was so grossed out. I went to the front desk and explained how disappointed I was and they let me look at a few other rooms they offered--all of them terrible. We stayed put as there was no sense in moving to another awful room and quickly went to bed. When I woke up the next morning there were TWO cockroaches in the bathroom. YUCK! Southern California, I get it, bugs can happen. Every other hotel we stayed at for the rest of the week was so lovely. Very clean, up to date, and well kept. We had a few other family members that stayed in different rooms at this hotel and they were all equally displeased. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. It ran me 135 after 12 for parking. We had 3 more rooms reserved at this hotel again for that Sunday but we canceled them immediately. Gross, outdated, smelly, and OVERPRICED. Never again will I stay at this hotel! BUYER BEWARE. Also, when I checked out of the hotel, the man at the desk asked me how everything was. I told him You don't want to know and the didn't have any response...not a sorry, to hear that, nothing..,
-1|I recently stayed at this property as it was listed as a three-diamond under AAA ratings and had bunk beds for my two young children. This hotel is not as nice as advertised. The room I had showed its age as it was looking dirty and worn. I also had one of the worst experiences I have ever had with the hotel personnel and management. Their customer service was very poor. On the second night of our stay the Toilet backed up a around 8:30 P.M. I called the front desk and was told there was no one who could fix it so I could move to another room. I declined this, as it would have taken at least an hour and a half to pack up, move, unpack and set up the room. My children were just going to bed so moving and doing the work would have been quite intrusive. I couldnt believe that they didnt have anyone who could plunge the toiled as this hotel has over 125 rooms. I asked if they had a plunger and the desk person stated he would look. He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable, as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager. She told me that it was good customer service to only offer a room change. I advised her of how much work it would that would have caused, and how disruptive it would have been to the young children and that it only took me a few seconds to fix the problem after I went out and bought the plunger. I told her she should be embarrassed about the customer service, she advised that she was proud of it and all of her employees. I asked for information on the ownership of the hotel, or her manager. She only would give me the choice 1-800 number. She actually stated that she didnt have that information. I asked for the name of who hired her she stated herself, I asked if she was the owner. She again would only say she didnt have that information. Earlier I had asked for compensation for the situation she insulting only offered to pay for the plunger. In the room was a card titled commitment to your Satisfaction, It stated states that if youre not satisfied with our accommodations or service, please the front desk know so we can make it right. At this property from the general manager on down they do not follow this policy. They definitely did not make it right.
-1|It looks decent from the outside but the rooms are dingy and dirty. We were on the second floor and heard EVERY step the people took above us! We also woke up to water under the sink seeping onto the bathroom floor! We gave it a try but we are moving on to another hotel today! DISAPPOINTEDWe are extremely sorry that our suites was not up to your expectations. Usually people who had stayed in the area do find our room more spacious and Comfortable compare to other hotels in the area and especially find good valued suites. They find it is indulging that they have 2 rooms with 2 TVs microwave and fridge.
-1|Place is so dirty and not well kept, but what got me the most is how unprofessional the night auditor was!!! He had such a bad attitude I even said to cancel my reservation cause I didn't care for his attitude. After I said that he immediately worked on my reservation faster and made sure I stayed, so I did....
-1|This has to be by far the nastiest and unkempt hotel I have ever seen! There were stains on everything...The shower curtain, chairs, wall and bed spread. Some of the staff was very rude.... Not to mention the power outlets have electrical burns and a prong was stuck in a ground plug outlet. Nothing that is claimed in the description...
-1|Last Saturday, we arrived on time and had paid through Hotels.com. Their is a wall-high GLASS that separates the customer from the check in clerks (first clue). The clerk was extremely slow and after 15 mins, still could not find our paid reservation on her computer. Meanwhile,a man walked in without a reservation, got a room and key and was...,
-1|If you stay here you are either desperate or have no where else to turn. This hotel is very aged in dire need of maintenance, cleaning, or needs to be condemned. As free wifi but did not work. Hotel smells of smoke with a very seedy crowd around it at all times of the night. Do not recommend this hotel...
-1|I understand that it is quite likely a great improvement over years past, however the refresh is superficial only. The floors still creak and were bowed and the climate control is minimal. The provided window air conditioner has not been serviced in some time and the air was not cool. I'm also concerned that the shampoo, shower gel and conditioner are not properly secured. I feel like someone had contaminated the shampoo, as it had a terrible smell, which unfortunately I did not discover until after I had it in my hair. The attached restaurant is well above average for the area and is the only redeeming quality in my opinion. The restaurant hours could be improved for in-house guests,
-1|Was travelling down to San Francisco on business and booked two hotel rooms at the last minute - all paid and confirmed...or so we thought. We showed up in a rush between meetings and the front desk informed us that we didn't have rooms any more because the people staying in our rooms had extended their stay! Hotel was supposed to find us rooms elsewhere but we ended up scrambling to find two other rooms. Disappointed as we always like to try and find the hidden jewel but this time we certainly found something else. Guess squatters rights still exist in San Francisco!
-1|I travel often to San Francisco (1-2 times a month) and while recently planning on going with my friends for a vacation I booked at Hotel Abri. Trying to save money, I found a decent deal for a hotel that had good reviews here. While not going into further detail, but noting that I had difficulty in checking-in due to housekeeping being short-staffed, there was much issue.The BIGGEST issue I had here was with getting spider bites from sleeping on the sofa bed. After showing the front desk, and after their inspection came out negative, they moved me rooms, but that was it. I still haven't heard back from a manager and was not offered any sort of compensation.I would suggest not going cheap and staying at the Parc 55 across the street.
-1|A lot of ventilation noise, it's impossible to sleep even the closed window ... In addition, it is necessary to know that it's the second year when we come and when we have the same chamber. It's unacceptable !! Look at the photo
-1|For what we got it was pretty expensive, although it seems all hotels in the area were pretty expensive. The room was very cramped with very little space besides the bed. The room also smelled weird and the staff were not helpful with respect to that. They gave a welcome bag with a bottle of cheap sangria, a small bag of chips, and some water bottles. The lobby has a couple of computers and some tea/coffee.Location of the hotel is pretty good - right near a big mall, the cable cars, subways/buses, and not too far from various attractions. Nice area to walk around in too.
-1|Recently booked the Hotel for a trip to San Francisco through Hotels.com and confirmation offered free cancellation but in reading fine print. The policy was backdated to a month before I booked the room. They don't even give you the opportunity to cancel less than 30 minutes after booking...beware!
-1|We arrived to check-in at 4pm. The person at the counter did not acknowledge us for 20 minutes while she casually talked to the customer in front. Then when it was our turn, our room was not available (and should have been ready at 3pm). When we arrived back later to settle in for the evening at 9pm, there was again a 10 minute wait at the counter. They gave us a gift bag for our inconvenience. The wine in the gift bag turned out to be rotten or corked. Now this bordered on absurd. The room itself was fine. When I asked to speak to the manager on our way out in the morning the receptionist said that he was not available, but would email me. It was truly a terrible example of customer service.
-1|the hotel has a cool vibe, there is no where to eat breakfast in the hotel so that's an issue, I had a problem with the reservation and was not accommodated on my request so that's impacted my experience after the fact. San Francisco has a huge homeless problem and unfortunately that impacts the surrounding area, I was disturbed by the number of homeless people sleeping on the street in front of the hotel so consider that before booking
-1|Our family of five (myself, my wife, and our three daughters) had booked a room as part of a block of guests for my wife's cousin's wedding on Saturday, onsite at the St. Regis hotel scheduled for 6:00 pm. I confirmed that we'd receive a double bed room in a few days ahead of our arrival, which was the same afternoon of the wedding.I called at 2:00pm that afternoon, an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00pm and the front desk told me they were finishing up our room, took down my cell phone number, and would call me when it was ready.We arrived around 2:30pm, stepped up to the counter to check-in at 2:50pm and our room was still not ready. OK, we thought perhaps a few more minutes ... which ticked away, and away, and away! My wife went back and asked for our room because we had to get prepared for the wedding! While the desk personnel were apologetic, they tried to offer a handicap accessible room, which we did not want. Then they tried to blame the situation on the fact that we had booked a king room on the reservation block for which they had already written and confirmed we reserved. The clock is ticking past 4:30pm ... and finally we get our room keys!We hurry outside to where our bags have been sitting on a luggage cart, tell the attendant that we have our room and need our bags immediately to prepare for the wedding, now about 1 hour away! We thought our bags would arrive on the heels of our entering the room, but NO ... again waiting ... so we started to prep the younger girls ... still no bags!My sixteen year old daughter went back down stairs and found our bags had not moved! She was livid ... and finally got them to start moving the cart. It was 5:15pm by the time our bags came. I understand that porter was just doing his job, when he asked if he could set up our bags in any particular place or if we needed ice, or how to operate the room controls ... but at that moment our immediate needs were for him to get the bags in the room as fast as possible and to leave so we can dress for the wedding! We all rapidly threw ourselves together ... my wife having triple duty ... in order to arrive a few floors down for the wedding.The entire experience of checking in was horrendous. From the call to confirm at 2:00 pm until we got our room and finally our bags! Not one of the hotel staff exhibited any sense of urgency for our situation. To appease us, they offered and we accepted to park our car onsite for a free night.On an afternoon full of anticipation for seeing family and friends at the wedding and reception (also at the St. Regis) ... we went through a tremendous amount of stress from that check-in experience. We're seasoned travelers so we can and have handled the ups and downs of travel ... in this case, I had to double my normal 24 hour rule for posting a negative review, because I'm still fuming. A five star hotel such as the St. Regis should never have their guests wait 2 hours past their own published check-in time to access their room.
-1|We booked through Orbitz, which included a 'non-refundable' policy. We asked to reschedule (not cancel) due to a death in the family. Vertigo denied the request via Orbitz. We were disappointed that Vertigo couldnt afford more flexibility. Consider booking elsewhere if life might happen.,
-1|Terrible Experience, I was there for a 60th Birthday, We had a lower room.105, People above sounded like they were playing volley ball till 11:00pm, and flushing the toilet all through the night. then it started again at 6:30 am. I was So Mad I...MoreWe feel terribly about this. We wish we had known about the experience you were having---we would have loved the opportunity to address the situation. If you contacted the front desk at any time and we failed to respond appropriately, we are deeply sorry. Your...
-1|The room was far below my expectations. I arrived at 1am and was given a handicap room with chipped paint and generally not clean. I expect so much more from the W and so much more the cost. I think I would have had a better experience at the Hyatt or Marriott. Very disappointed
-1|Downtown hotel that was hard to find as entrance/parking garage is around the corner from the actual address. The sign out front is very small. Overnight parking is exhorbitant we used a garage 5 blocks away, although there are others closer by. Room was interesting L shape with view over street. Furnishings were all fine although 2 lightbulbs were burnt out. Staff was helpful, but busy. Pub next door is half the price (or less) than hotel restaurant. I noticed traffic noise, especially truck honking early in morning and siren that went by. Not a poor hotel, just not my style for visiting a city and making everything convenient.,
-1|Centrally located, close to Pike Place and other key points of interest. Room was spacious, but unfortunately, I really missed their wonderful Heavenly Beds! They must not have these beds at this location, as one of the receptionists hadn't even heard of the Heavenly Beds! Further, the water pressure in my room, located on the 10th floor, was abysmal despite having housekeeping try to make an adjustment to the shower head valve. The water pressure out of the shower head was incredibly poor. The check-in experience was awkward since I couldn't hear well, as I had a late check-in (10pm), and the check-in desk is located in the loud hotel bar, which was pumping with bass and loud music. It was sincerly shocking that Emma, the pleasant check-in receptionist, asked if I would be willing to forego daily cleaning service in exchange for 500 Westin points per night! It's bewildering that this arguably 'five-star' hotel would even suggest such an option for their guests. I'll likely be trying other hotels in the neighborhood on future trips that will hopefully have stronger, more satisfying water pressure.
-1|Lost reservation, incompetence by staff overcharge credit cards.....that was my experience at the Grand Hyatt.After a long day of travelling to reach hotel and to be told issues with reservation, Front desk staff are either incompetent or lack required training for position. hotel sold out for the weekend. Asked to speak with someone with authority, asst. manager now involved. All I can say.... thank goodness reservation was booked thru an executive / director with the Hyatt chain.... Or we would of been screwed royally.Checkout was a disaster. Credit cards presented and staff unable to handle splitting the charges to two credit cards. Not only do they charge full amount to both cards, but do it twice. Trying to correct was a nightmare. Once back in Canada, numerous calls and numerous employees in Accounting involved. With the exchange on the CDN dollar, I'm still out of pocket for their error.Plus side, never again. Avoid this property. Other great properties in the vicinity that I'm sure offer better service!!!!!!To management, suggest additional training required for your front desk and accounting staff. Appears they have no clue in the process for checking in, customer service, or processing credit card payments and credits.
-1|I called there asking to speak to my husband in the room in which he was staying. I gave the first and last name. I had failed to ask my husband for the room number...however due to the fact that I was not staying there and never been asked that before by any other hotel I was a little confused....
-1|My family and I went to Nashville for a vacation which was almost ruined by the condition of the rooms at the Days Inn North hotel. We were there for a total of four nights, and on the second night, I was attacked by bed bugs. I received over thirty bites! The pain is unbearable and I would not wish...
-1|My family and I were visiting Nashville for a weekend getaway and we found the only thing we wanted to get away from was the room we stayed in. The advertised pictures and description of the rooms were very misleading. It smelled like a moldy basement and the bug falling from the curtain was an uninvited guest. The continental breakfast...
-1|Hotel is located about a 10-15 minute drive from downtown Nashville. Employees all were very nice. They are currently renovating and have construction going on. Did not have water (at all, no hot or cold, nothing) so not being able to take a shower after work is just unacceptable. Water was off for a few hours. Room was clean, but...
-1|Not what I expected our room felt like it was in a basement damp and humid so much so that the bathroom door didn't even close all the way Window air conditioner sounded like a freight train kept us up all night Free breakfast and laundry on site were nice
-1|The hotel looks good, and I don't know if things have gotten bad lately, but when we stayed there it was noisy as heck and the place is run by kids. We stayed AT FIRST (but not for long) on the first floor. Whatever was going on above us sounded like a wrestling match. It was there when we checked...
-1|Clean the bathrooms. Noisy! After driving 10 hours, you wa, nna unwind call it a night. Don't do it there! Small plastic tiolet seat. Tub to dirty to put your feet in! I travel a lot. Stayed in quality inns. Just never this one again!
-1|We tried this motel for the first time. Seemed convenient for us to stop there for the night. From this experience, I have learned to always ask to see the rooms before I lay down my credit card. the lobby looks nice...but that was it! As soon as you open the doors to the hotel halls, there was a musty,...
-1|We reserved a room with 2 queen beds. We were given room 1 (The Mayberry room) and were really excited based in the other reviews for the motel. The room does not have 2 queen beds it has 2 double beds. Room was small, bathroom was small. Shower only, no tub. No light in the closet, 3 plastic hangers. Window...
-1|The management of the property are nice enough people but they fall victim to some of the clientele that somehow cannot help themselves but to have police called on them. After the police left I heard yelling in the hall between a manager and people and it got extremely heated. I checked in at 8:30am and attempted to check out...
-1|Upon our arrival and during our stay the staff was the highlight. There was plenty of toilet paper, but the holder would not hold it up. The water was hot and pressure good, but the handle kept falling off. The bed was very comfortable and clean. It was in the morning we found unwelcome guest in our clothes.....very small ants!!!! We have only stayed at this Drury once and of course I cannot speak for the other rooms, but I will not stay there again. The staff was wonderful and our bill was adjusted very nicely, but the vermin bite! The hotel is in a great location to down town and the port if you are cruising.,
-1|I have stayed at this Drury Inn every other year when I visit New Orleans during Mardi Gras Season. This year was no different... To make a long story short- Drury Inn charged me for two rooms but failed to let me know that upon arrival or checking in the hotel (I had apreviously called the hotel to cancel the reservation FYI). After I noticed the charge on my account I called and spoke with the manager Patrick to reverse the charges. He was super rude, loud talking over me, and had an I dont care attitude. He stated that he would fax in the necessary paperwork to my bank as they requested via email.( that was a Sunday) Monday went and still no funds-Tuesday came and still no funds. At this point my automatic withdrawals started to come out of the account. Which enabled my account to go in the negative and it set a domino effect. I checked in on Saturday and my bank froze my account due to suspicious fraud so I wasnt able to get any money off my account (but it didnt matter because Drury Inn had it all wrap up). Tuesday before I left I spoke with my bank and they told me they never received the proper paperwork so I went to the front desk and spoke with Jaime and she faxed the proper info over for me. Not even 30 minutes later my bank called me and said they received the paperwork and the funds are credited to my account. Now on to the housekeeping- our room had not been cleaned the entire time we were there- which was a Saturday through a Tuesday. Yes the trash was emptied and the beds covers had been pulled over( which I had an issue with because the first day the sheets I had had urine stains on them) after I returned back to the room I asked if someone could come change my sheets. When I returned I asked the front desk if it was taken care of and they stated yes (what they didnt know is that I put a quarter in the middle of the bed under the covers). When I came to the room it was still there. The entire I was there no one vacuum the floor and I had to call everyday to ask for towels - the minimum required towels was not left in my room after cleaning it. I had a few questions and concerns for the manager Patrickbut he blew me off, loud talking me, his exact words were you did this so deal with it. Tuesday morning I attempt email to contact the manager Slade about the situation just to let him know that my bank stated they never received the authorization to reverse funds but he never called me back and I called him at 8:22 am. Yes I went down to the front desk and Jaime took care of it but he was avoiding me because he did not want to handle the situation. His exact words were you would have to call Patrick because he knows the situation and I dont have anything to do with it since he already knows the story. The crazy thing is I actually love this hotel but I wont ever be staying here again when I come to New Orleans. Talk about unprofessional and unable to handle a situation! By the way if I could give a negative 22 on the score I would. All weekend I was suppose to be enjoying the festivities for my birthday but I had to continuously run up behind Drury Inn for answers. What if I didnt have any cash on me how was I going to be able to get back home Im so disgusted by it ALL.,
-1|Nice looking hotel, nice rooms and amenities, Not as good as other drury hotels i have stayed at, the food wasnt great, and drinks were very watered down. and one night i was loudly awakened at 1.30am from the fire alarm, had to rush down the steps 7 floors, stand outside for 15 mins for someone to tell us the front desk staff hit the wrong button, not acceptable.,
-1|You just have to read some of the other reviews for this place to realize that there are some major shortcomings in its management. Clearly not indicative of the Westin brand. We made the mistake of not researching the hotel before making a parking reservation after Christmas. Cutting to the chase, our car was broken into in the garage while we were away (as was the car parked next door). We arrived back late at night to find plastic taped over the window and glass everywhere. The security guard at the hotel showed us a police report and told us that two suspects were arrested, gave us the name and number of the GM and sent us on our way. It is now March - our calls to the GM have never been returned - voicemail every time. 297 out of pocket for replacing the glass in the passenger window plus the cost of items stolen, but we don't have a copy of the police report to pass along to our insurance agent because the hotel management appear not to give two craps about a) what happens at this property, and b) basic customer service. Do yourself a favor and find an alternative.On behalf of the hotel we apologize for the unfortunate incident with your car. You can obtain a copy of the police report by contacting the College Park Police Department at 404-761-3131.,
-1|Let me begin by accentuating the positive, check in staff and shuttle drivers are friendly and efficient. Room is dated but not dirty. Air didn't work properly. Lunch buffet although tasty is no where worth 22.00 for 2 meats , 2 vegetables and salad.pool and hot tub were gross. A dirty film covered the water. Hair was everywhere. Very dirty. Wait staff at the bar are rude . They act like you are bothering them to ask for service. This hotel is no where worth the they charge. Also watch your bill. They tried to charge me for items that I didn't buy. The Marriott just across the street is a much better option.On behalf of the entire hotel staff we appreciate you taking the time to write a review, Thank you for the nice comments on our staff. Our lunch prices are comparable to the other full service hotels in the market, We will have our engineers check the filtering system at the pool to see if there is an issue. We will address your comments about the service at the bar with the Food and Beverage Director.,
-1|We stay at LaQuinta's regularly. This one fell below the others in three areas. The desk staff did not seem to be really up on things, the internet was extremely slow and disconnected frequently, and the blackout curtains were inefficient and couldn't compete with a light that was right outside our window.
-1|I think the price for the rooms was overpriced. The room was not very clean for the and the exhaust fan in the bathroom was very loud. There is a refrigerator and microwave in the room. The refrigerator did keep the stuff cold.
-1|Staff was courteous helpful and friendly. Great location however would not stay there again. Complimentary breakfast was good. Free parking. Rooms are clean but in need of updating. Beds are not comfortable at all.
-1|One night staff theaten to call police and lock the doors as one our members (coach was in the sitting area with a player). He was rude and could of spoke to the guests in a polite manner before giving the rude ultimatum as there was a loud party not from our group making noise the night before. Rooms has a old smell and I had to spray the pillows and sheets with frebreeze. Housekeeping missed cleaning our room one day as they said we refused cleaning, I asked all the guest in the room and they said this never happened. Also housekeeping was performed very late in many of our groups rooms. Perhaps more cleaning staff is needed during the busy Albion cup weekend. The internet needs faster speed, perhaps this is the way Hampton makes money if guest are frustrated with the complimentary internet.Rooms should have 2 queen beds instead of 2 double beds as they are very small for 4 adults. I used the coffee maker/fridge/microwave, happy they were available but they could use upgrading.The pool was cool and there was no hot tub. It would also be benificial to have laundry on site- even if we have to pay for it. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to future guest on Tripadvisor,
-1|Shuttle only available if someone working at the time can drive it, which was never over 4 days there. Restaurant nearby is a Taco Bell in the parking lot. When spoke with front desk about problems, I was simply told the staff would be talked to, no effort to make up for poor service and misrepresentation.
-1|Rude staff. Staff had no clue about restaurants or nearby amenities. They were clueless. Room Was on first floor by parking lot and loud. Heater was also loud. Paid 160/nt. Not worth it. It does have underground free parking.
-1|Bad eggs for breakfast (they tasted more like mashed potatoes not eggs) / Not able to take a bath due to drain not working to hold up the water.. On either issue, staff did not really feel like it was of any concern.... :(,
-1|Careful when you book this place, especially if you book via a third party! We booked and supposedly paid for the hotel when we booked it, yet we had money taken when we checked out. I have since been informed by the company that I booked it through that this is a non refundable hotel and therefore we had already paid! so we now have to claim a refund from Hampton Inn for charging us twice! Not a comfortable nights sleep, pillows were terrible, WIFI was in and out, staff were unhelpful and so on. Simple sum up here, stay somewhere else!
-1|Please avoid this hotel. After Hampton Inn lost our reservation, Lilana was the rudest customer service employee I have encountered in a very long time. I frequently stay at Hampton Inn and was shocked at the treatment I received. The smallest amount of courtesy would have solved my problem without incident. I have never posted a review, but wanted everyone to be spared a similar experience.
-1|If you are just looking for a cheaper hotel in Del Mar, this may even be a fair choice, if you don't mind very dirty rooms, no parking spaces if you arrive after 10 PM, scant breakfast if you get it after 8:30 AM and practically unresistant concierge service.,
-1|I was disappointed about the Hampton Inn Del Mar. My preferences as Hilton Honors member were ignored. The room we were given overlooked a Taco Bell and the freeway. Needless to say the noise level was great. The front desk staff simply did not care about our satisfaction. The lamps did not work. I have stayed at Hampton Inns before and have been satisfied but this was not the case with this hotel. On a positive note the breakfasts were pretty good.
-1|Beware there is limited space for have breakfast in the morning, so get there early. Watch where you park, some guest may have just walked their dog. Hope the people above you know how to be respectful of those below, elephants above make a lot of noise. If you happen to visit on a day that may involve children you may want to pick another hotel, we could hear virtually everything going on around us. We have stayed at Hampton's before and this is why we have stopped visiting. We try to visit Homewood's as their rooms are almost sound proof. We once stayed in a Homewood with a family of seven next door (children teenagers) and we never knew there was anyone even next door. At this property, we could hear the parents, next door, telling their kids to go to sleep, as if it was on the tv we were watching.
-1|We were here for a family vacation during the summer. The customer service in this hotel was poor as well as the air conditioning unit was dated and did not work properly. The hallways were not air conditioned and it was hot. The bathroom tub had cracks in it.We are sorry we were not able to provide you with a better quality of service. This is not typical of our usual Hamptonality and welcoming staff, and we are always looking for ways to improve our customer experience. We'd also like to apologize for the malfunctioning air conditioner in your guest suite and have reported the issue to our maintenance team. Thank you for your feedback and we hope you will come back and stay with us again soon.,
-1|This is a review of the customer service that I experienced at the Hilton. You would certainly expect better customer service from a 4-star hotel. After booking, I immediately reviewed the information and noticed the date was incorrect. So I called them to make the necessary correction. Apparently, it routed to a different date because the preselected date was not available (that's what the agent told me). They would not give me a refund, allow me to change my date, or even a credit to be applied to future reservations (not even a partial credit!). Now I'm stuck with a reservation that I can't even use. Thus, this review will only be limited to the customer service as I won't be able to use the reservation to enjoy the room. After this experience, I'm boycotting the Hilton. It's unfortunate as I always choose the Hilton above other hotels. No longer a fan!
-1|We were looking for a place to stay in San Francisco for the family (3 kids) and found Royal Pacific Motor Inn on hotels.com. I compared the price at hotels.com with the price if I were to book directly at the hotel on their own web-site. The price was almost the same (156 USD + tax, total 186 USD incl. tax), but I made the booking through hotels.com because there it was clear that we could stay 5 people in the room (often there is a limit of four persons which makes it a bit difficult if you have three children). At check out time they wanted to charge me 215 USD per night incl tax, that is almost 30 USD extra per night. They refused to acknowledge that my price was given including tax. So they have charged me two times for the tax.This is a kind of discussion you don't want to end up with during a vacation so make sure you have a correct quote if staying here. Otherwise the hotel was OK.
-1|I needed a no frills place to sleep during the day and wifi internet while I was working in Denver overnight.I though a large chain would be a safe bet. I talked with the person working the desk and she let me check in early (12 noon instead of 3pm) and I thought I was off to a good start,... ,

-1|We have stayed at a Hampton Inn several times because we are family of 5 and it is accommodating. Since the rate is usually between 125 and 200 you get what you pay for. This time we definitely DID NOT GET WHAT WE PAID FOR. Because it was Easter weekend, we were charged 350 per night. What we did get...,
-1|Yesterday Sunday March 27, I reserved a one bed room for one night and later I upgraded my reservation for a room with two beds because my daughter was coming with us. Now I have been charged for two rooms! I want you to reimburse me my money!,
-1|Let's just call a spade a spade. There was an arrest outside of our hotel room at 1am. The place was filthy. Never stay here. However, the people running it were very helpful, kind people. I hope that they can invest in their property and make it better.
-1|From the tattered mattresses to the joke of a breakfast, this place is the place of bad dreams. Which is exactly what I kept having when I realized our door DIDN'T LOCK PROPERLY. The only positive thing about this place was that the front desk person was polite and courteous.,
-1|We found hair in the tub, we found bugs in the bed, we had a gap in an old suite door that you could see other room and they could see us. the people whom stayed next to us had two very large and loud barking doors. when we called about the issue we got no reply until we made...
-1|If you are considering a visit to the pacific coast, don't wast your money on this place unless you are wanting to go somewhere to read or write a book. Our family just returned very disappointed. Granted, we are used to sunshine and palm trees, and were mentally prepared for that not being there, but the beach and little town...,
-1|We found this hotel online with a discount coupon. Checked out the website and everything looked great...it boasts free shuttle service to Disneyland and Knotts and that it is a mile and a half away from Disneyland. Try about 5 miles. Took forever to find it. It was in this wierd, old part of town, off the beaten path, right on the main drag of Brookhurst street. Outside appearance was a little icky. It had an unattractive closed down restaurant as part of the hotel and an old shuttle that was sitting in the front. To our dismay, there were no longer any shuttle services offered. The rooms were old and a little bit dingy. You can hear people in the other rooms taking showers. The beds were not at all comfortable. TV got only a few stations. Definately not what we expected. We thought it was going to be a classy hotel by Disneyland. We felt slightly misled by the website. The perks The rooms had a microwave and little refridgerator. The pool was nice and secluded, very quiet and clean. My nephew and I swam for 2 hours, all alone! We were the only ones out there, it was great! Friendly staff, willing to help. Overall, this wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I will be much more diligent in the future when I do research for hotels.
-1|I will never step foot in this motel and i strongly encourage anyone to not even think about staying at this place. It is the junkiest motel you will ever step foot in, their costumer service is a JOKE! My fiance and I needed a place to stay for 3 days, so we paid a deposit for those days, well...
-1|This was at one time and could be again, a great place! Most of the rooms open to the hall and the outside. Problem is, people smoke right out side the doors, and some even left the doors to the halls open, so the smoke went through the entire hall and other rooms. I wondered why the staff never said...,
-1|Would not honor reservation price when checking in will never stay here again. Booked room because having major surgery a 5 am next day didn't need this stress. Tried to tell me I booked a room with one bed, not true have reservation,
-1|Convenient area to freeway in Culver City. Easy to book thru Booking.com. I chose not to stay after viewing room. Carpet needed vacuuming, mirrors with fingerprints, hair in sink, dusty furniture, poor quality of towels. Called Booking.com who were extremely helpful in talking with manager of motel. We received full refund.,
-1|There are several other hotels in the area I would try the others before this one. I would not choose this Travelodge ever again. Service was not great rooms were bad. They even charge for ice. Good luck
-1|Sorry to have to say that this was a total disappointment. When I checked in, I was told that someone had called and cancelled the last two nights. I informed the clerk that did not happen and she argued that there was a note on the booking. I should have left then. The room was sprayed with something to cover...,

-1|First of all, it's a miracle that this motel is still standing and mostly functional. It's very authentic for what it was built for, which is to say cheap, one-night lodging for people driving long distance. But this place is not for everyone, at least. The rooms are spartan, in keeping with earlier times, and not very big. Our room...

-1|It served the purpose of being close to the airport. Other than that, not much good to say. Very dated, loud heater that made it hard to sleep, awful towels. Had the creeps all night. Housekeeping did as good as they could with old used-up rooms.
-1|The manager kept changing rates without notice during my stay. Questionable business ethics. Only cereal and coffee for breakfast. Noisy except in rear rooms, which are not used in winter. Poor maid service.,

The Place looked nice from outside... but room we got reeked with smell of cigarretts! Complained about it and was told that no rooms to trade was given a can of room deodorizer..Needless to say...
-1|Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.
-1|The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent value,
-1|The hotel was noisey during the night with people coming and going knocking on doors and people walking around all night long. I could not reccommend staying there. The internet was not working and there was no attempt to get it fixed. Some tall black guy walking around minding everyones business.
-1|While the room itself was clean enough, with newly renovated bathrooms, it stank of Lysol, and since I would not advise leaving the windows open, given the homeless people and drug addicts who wander around the open halls here, the rooms can be quite stuffy. But the problem is less the room, but rather the kinds of people that management allow to stay in the rooms. We stayed next door to Room 29 which is blatantly a brothel with people coming and going all night, and I even got solicited one night for some fun by a prostitute in the parking lot. Random people knocking on our door at 5am, smashing bottles outside the door, people arguing and fighting in the middle of the night. Rows of homeless people sleeping around the sides of the building. While they do have a security guard who wanders around, he does not do very much. The area is not dangerous per se, as we would come back for nights out on the town late at night and no one bothers you walking the streets as long as you mind your business. I could go on, but do yourself a favor, and dig into you pocket, pay a few dollars  and stay away from this place. That way, you can actually enjoy your stay in SF.
-1|We know people start a motel to make money .... but this is crazy !! The guy who helped us was very nice to us, nothing wrong there ... we got the room via booking.com ( bastards) the room looked okay at first ... pretty clean, a bit old, but okay ... but after our first night we had red little spots on our bodies ...we thought we had mosquito bites, but after another night we knew it were BedBugs ... we looked it up later on .... and we knew it cam from the bed .... what a bummer .... !!,
-1|Our window was broken, luckily we were on the third floor but it got very cold, and the heat had only one setting which was 80 so then we got heated out, heard sirens all night and loud cars, and they wouldnt move us to another room. Phone didnt work so each time we had a problem we had to walk all the way over to the office. Needles and homeless people all over the stairways. Elevator smelled of urine so bad we could never take it. No hot water, and very low water pressure. It was in downtown SF in which is another story, of course tons of homeless sleeping everywhere around the hotel. Lobby workers very rude and uncaring.
-1|we booked this hotel and they told us we could cancel our reservation 24 hours before the stay.i read the reviews and saw the hotel was bad. So i canceled. They said there was no cancelation policy. So I canceled my credit card. But then I found out that the charge went through.
-1|The biggest problem of this hotel is the location, the hotel itself is not that bad. It is clean in general, rooms are very tiny, it doesn't have a fridge and microwave. So basically that's a fine place to sleep, have shower and not more than this. So, If you plan just to sleep in that hotel several nights, it is fine. The hotel can't be blamed, that the district is full of homeless, hookers, drug dealers and junk. However, that district it still in historical part of the city and very close to the Market St and the tram lines.
-1|I am so sad I did not see the ratings for this place before I made 2 nights reservation. My family and I rented 3 rooms and what a mistake! One room had dirty sheets and we had to ask twice before they came and changed them. The maids did not seem happy about the ekstra work and for them where sheets with stains are apprently clean sheets no matter what. They even started to argue about it with my husband!The cable tv was not working proberly and the channels we could recieve was not even the same in all 3 room even though they where located right next to each other. Many of the channels kept on freezeing both the picture and the sound.No airconditioner in any of the rooms. The surrounding area seem quite dodgy, particuly at the back of motel. The homepage promise free high speed internet in all the rooms, but ups! That only works in the lobby! The beds are exstreamly small even acording to european standard! There are no refrigeater in the rooms. The window in the bedroom are plainted over with white paint so people can't look in, but several spots are free of paint and there are no curtain.Buttom line: I'm NEVER comming back again to this place!
-1|Please DO NOT book this place. As soon as I got there, I felt scared. However, I couldn't leave because I couldn't find an affordable place due to a convention going on. I thought that I would spend all day doing tourist stuff, and just come here to sleep, but it was a nightmare! There are a bunch of homeless people, drunk, high, suspicious etc around the area. I'm from a country with the highest crime in the World and I have been in many cities, but I have never felt so scared. There are trash bags in the stairs and they smell like pee. The rooms smell like weed and smoke further the smell of cleaning chemicals were worst. I didn't see bed bugs however, there were hairs in the sheets. It feels like they never changed them. The shower didn't work. I heard two men next to our bedroom having loud sex. I saw 3 transsexual men in the room downstairs in underwear. People tried to get in our room several times therefore, I put the table against the door. If you have family, don't even think about staying here.
-1|Room was super clean, bed was great. Now the not so great stuff. Bathroom was like the inside of a cave. One weak light, barely enough to see what you're doing. Shower needs to be redone as floor was badly chipped and looked super bad....
-1|The lobby and staff were very nice, but once you leave downstairs it is run down, has an old dcor, and smells far from pleasing. The rooms are tiny, and we asked to be switched to another room because the air conditioning unit was so loud. The 2nd room was equally as bad. I work in the hospitality industry and would never recommend this hotel to anyone.,
-1|Situated right on the Chinatown gates, Astoria is perfectly located. A few blocks from the muni the cable cars, bart within 1 block but the hotel itself is terrible but it's very cheap. The whole place needs a refurb something doing about the smell which lingered in the corridor room.I found the bed comfy but won't be in a rush to go back. We were also lucky to receive complimentary pubes in the bathroom on arrival.
-1|While this place is relatively inexpensive, it isn't worth the savings! As soon as we walked in, we noticed the room smelled like urine. There was no remote for the tiny television, the towels looked worn and unclean, the mattress was as hard as a rock, there is no ventilation (no ac, no fan) in the room and there are no screens on the windows. The worst part was that we were attacked by mosquitoes all night! The tub didn't drain properly (while I was showering, I was standing in several inches of water) and the bath mat for the outside of the tub was a piece of paper! It is a shame because it is obviously a hotel that has been in SF for a long time, and could be charming if the owners took better care of it. We will never stay here again.
-1|Dirty sensation. Carpet full of cigarrettes holes. Very old and used. Very noisy AC. Free parking. Thick walls, you listen your neighbourgs snoring. The are is nice, bacause you have some bars around and the neighbouhood is suitable. Near Fillmore Street (genuine american, San Francisco Street, full of live, no tourists).If your budget is low, and you are not very ambitious with the room, is one the cheapest way to stay in SF. Leave you lugage and go to visit the city.,
-1|The hotel is simply horrible, dirty, smelly and noisy beyond belief. The sheets have not been changed when we booked the room and mould and dirt were 'dripping' out of the extractor in the bathroom. Even for 100 a night it was a torture. I stayed in the area a few years ago in the Ramada hotel which is now unfortunately closed, the hotel was simply lovely. While searching for a similar hotel, Greenwich Inn appeared, I don't know what I was thinking booking it..
-1|This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Beware of room 20. This is the room with the weird vent on the door. So noisy and cold because you can't close it. Holes in sheets. Grimy, old and dirty. You are desperate if you stay here.,
-1|The room was covered in boxwood beetle bugs, both dead and alive. While I understand there was an infestation in Ridgecrest, I would think the cleaning staff would be sure to vacuum at least the dead ones and attempt to get rid of the live ones. I told the office staff and they were nice, but just repeated that there...
-1|You can't expect much for 50, however our room was clean, although the furnishing are well worn. The bathroom was large and AC worked. The area attracted homeless folk which may put guests at ill-ease. Doors did triple lock.
-1|We booked here for a week months ago. As our cruise dates changed, we emailed our cancellation notice. We received confirmation of the cancellation and was shocked to find out that our Visa was charged the first night despite the fact that we had cancelled a week prior to our arrival.Our Visa company is now trying to recuperate our funds, but no reputable hotel would be so underhanded. ALL attempts to communicate the management/owners of the hotel has been to no avail.Do NOT book here unless you are 100 sure, do not risk it. We're out over 100 US but it's the principle of it that hurts us more than the money! Shysters!
-1|This hotel is definitely not top notch. If you can book it cheap then it will provide you with a bed and a bathroom and cable TV. One thing that really pissed me off was that the wifi is extremely slow that it's almost impossible to use.So if you can book it cheap, good for you, if not, look for somewhere else.
-1|the room was horrible with dirty showers. I would agree: that's the worst hotel I have ever been respectively that I left before I slept there as I just couldn't imagine, sleeping there during my holidays! I certainly will not recoomend this place to my friends!,
-1|We arrived in San Francisco on the Friday, did some sight seeing, bought souvenirs, We eventually got to the hotel around 9pm, we parked on the street just minutes away from the hotel, there were a few homeless people in the streets and didn't think too much of it, Next morning we went to our rental vehicle only to see it was broken into and a few of our belongings were stolen, The front desk was helpful in calling the police for us to get things sorted out. The next night we chose to pay for the valet service at 35.00 a night. because once we did more driving around we realized it was a very bad neighbourhood, not child friendly or even adult friendly for that matter . The hotel offered coffee and juice and the morning and this was not very good. Overall was not enjoyable to stay
-1|Food was very bad fruit was bad coffee warm not hot because water was not hot exercise equipment broken ice machine removed from floor hotel under renovation the staff was very nice wash cloth and towels dingyMoreI want to apologize for your experience. We are undergoing lobby renovations, and I can assure you your concerns are not going unheard. I have addressed your issues with my Maintenance and Housekeeping Departments. We do hope you will allow us another opportunity to serve...,
-1|I agree with all of the other reviews that say this hotel is shabby and run down. Staff are slow and totally not helpful. We had a suite across the street, well OMG, It was like something out of a horror show. We came from Canada and didn't know the city at all. We had picked up a hotel guide along the way and the Knights Inn was the featured hotel so we thought it had to be okay. Who ever put out that guide should be sued. Thank God we were able to find another hotel the next day. The room had bed bugs and when I told the person at the desk she accused me of bringing them with me.I tried to get a hold of Varsha Patel but she never called us back. I see she is quick to respond to bad reviews though. You are better off sleeping on the street instead of staying at this dump!!! Varsha wake up and smell the coffee! Go across the street and sleep in one of your rooms then you will know what everyone is talking about.
-1|I booked a room at the Ramada Limited Downtown San Francisco for 4 nights (19-23 May 2007) six months in advance at a room rate of 113 per night plus tax. The advertisement stated that there was free continental breakfast, free wireless internet in the rooms, refurbished large rooms, free coffee makers, etc. Despite having booked well in advance I did not get a room in the hotel but rather in the annex and at the same room rate. The annex was across the street and partway down the block and this was not at all like what was advertised.1 There were no elevators. I had to carry my bags up several fights of stairs to get to the room.2 The room was tiny (9 x 13 feet) and had only a single twin bed. My confirmation was for a queen-sized bed.3 The room was dark because the light bulbs had been removed from the lamps and the overhead light was dim. The carpet was filthy, so perhaps this was deliberate.4 There was no internet access. There might have been access if you walked back across the street and down the block to the main building and then stood in the lobby but I did not try this,5 The continental breakfast was only available to guests in the main building according to Samir, the desk clerk.6 There was no coffee or coffee maker.7 There was no bathtub - only a small shower stall. In any case, it would be ill advised to take a shower because only two thin hand towels were provided for guests making it impossible to dry off.8 The air conditioner was broken. It was running but not cooling and all of the knobs had been removed so it was impossible to adjust any settings. Perhaps for this reason, the room had a foul odor.I returned to the main building, it was now about 3.30 PM, and I asked Samir for a different room - similar to what was advertised when I booked the room. He told me this was impossible. I then told him that I would not be using the room and I would find other accommodations and he told me that my credit card would still be billed the full amount because I had already checked in. I returned to my room down the street and I called Ramada customer service telephone support and a nice fellow named Jason (I believe) agreed that this was a problem but he said that all Ramada properties are independently owned and thus he could do nothing for me. He gave me the name of the manager of this property and suggested that I keep trying to contact him directly.I packed an overnight bag and left my luggage in the room as I did not want to haul it down the stairs and around the city looking for another room and I was going to be charged for the room anyway. I stayed in the Marriott that night and retuned the next day to check out of the Ramada. At the desk was the acting manager, Bobbie, who explained that the manager, Mr. Monday, was in Indonesia. Bobbie had not been told anything about my problem but he quickly found me an acceptable room in the main building and helped me move my bags so I completed my stay at the Ramada. In compensation for my problems and having to take a room at the Marriott the first night he took 12.90 (!) off my total bill of 515.76 (not very impressive).I am extremely dissatisfied by this affair. The property is not as advertised and the price is far in excess for similar rooms in the city. Indeed, the room I was given in the annex was dangerous and uninhabitable. The Ramada staff at the hotel were unwilling to help until I was about to leave early, the telephone support from Ramada was unable to help resolve this problem.,
-1|I LOVE San Francisco but this place was not a highlight. We waited for almost an hour just to check in (checkout was not much better) and in that time 3-4 different people made complaints ranging from no hot water to toilets being blocked (2 Toilets), the receptionist handed them a plunger to deal with it themselves!! When we finally got checked in we had to go accross the road and up steep narrow stairs (which I fell on twice) to get to our room which was not much bigger than the queen size bed in there. Their free wi-fi only works in the reception area and the breakfast a danish or muesli bar (only allowed 1) was very lacking!The neighbourhood left A LOT to be desired, I did not feel safe. It is in a bad part of town and is not local to the shopping area.This is one place I will not be going anywhere near EVER again.
-1|DISGUSTING DUMP! If this hotel is an example of the Ramada chain the health department should shut them down. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I shall never visit another Ramada hotel again. The room stinks. I am guessing the carpets have never been cleaned. The room was not cleaned. The bathroom is filthy. The tv gets 4 channels and stopped working the second day. The elevator does not work so all luggage had to be taken up to the top floor by hand. The phone does not work, the sheets are full of holes and the curtains smell. DO NOT STAY AT RAMADA HOTELS. I believe deseases cold be hatching in the rooms. Where is the San Francisco health department to protect the public Health department and tourist bureau start doing your job, SHUT THE DUMP DOWN NOW!.
-1|My wife and I were just staying at the hotel for one night and believe me when I say I didn't expect much to begin with because you get what you pay for, which is fine.I just needed an economical stay for one night - that's all.Well this one night stay turned out to be a nightmare!1) We arrived very late because our flight got delayed into San Fran. When we finally got to the hotel it was after midnight and there was one attendant working the front desk.As he was checking us in, the hotel system went down. The man spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out what to do and could not check us in at all. When he finally had everything back up, it all went down again which led to a much longer wait just to get our room. We finally got our room key well past 1am, which was after more than an hour of waiting.2) This next issue makes the first one seem like nothing.Our room was on the 3rd floor and the next morning I wanted to go move my car closer to our room. I called up the one and only elevator they have in the place and took it down to the main floor. Well just before I got to the first floor the elevator just stopped. I realized It was stuck. It is a very small and old elevator which made me feel so claustrophobic! I pressed all the buttons trying to go back up, open the door, the alarm button and what not. I even knocked on the door and screamed for help.I was in the elevator for about 10 minutes but it seemed like an hour and no one came to my assistance. Finally I kept holding the door open button and the door opened a crack and I pushed it open the rest of the way. It was on the ground floor thankfully so I was able to walk out. I had a did that just happen moment and was in total shock.What was even more shocking was that there was a sign on the first floor noting the the elevator was out of service! That's great but where was the frickin sign on the second and third floors Who was the genius that decided one sign would be enoughI got to the front desk and spoke with the man on duty and explained the situation. All he said was that he's new and he will put signs on the other floors (better late than never) and that the manager wasn't in that day so they would reach out to me.I took the manager's email address just in case. We checked in and got the hell out of there.Well it's been a week now and I haven't heard anything from management at all. In fact I emailed them a few days ago explaining why I had such a horrible situation to give them a chance to address it and I've gotten nothing back.I realize the elevator situation and the system going down might just be bad luck but it's how the staff responded that makes me upset. Absolutely no customer service whatsoever.If you decide to stay here don't expect service you'd get from an average hotel. It's far worse.
-1|The room was tiny and there was nowhere to sit in the room except for the beds and 2 small chairs. One chair had a cigarette burn on it and the other chair had a stain that looked like skid marks.

-1|We had to stay here during the Hurricane Irma and this place was the only place I could get a room for my family. The one good thing I can say is the staff is really nice. The room smelled old and the bathroom was gross. Well actually the whole hotel from the elevator up to our room smelled old. luckshot88, Thank you for your review of our hotel. We appreciate all feedback and are working to improve our aesthetic and functionality of our products continuously.,
-1|Just stayed here Feb '12. Not a horrible place for the . I paid 85 for the room and it's right in downtown atlanta next to the marriot. Usually the location at lone would command 100 minimum per night. Parking was confusing. i don't like to pay for valet so I opted to park my car alone when I pulled up, and about 100ft down the street from the main entrance is a parking garage in the same bldg, so I parked there (15 a day). Upon walking to the desk to check in I was informed their parking garage is cheaper, but it's located caddy corner across the st to the hotel (weird). The desk clerk tried to convince me to go get my car from where it was parked and pull it into their garage - again, weird. I was put on the 9th floor (elevator is pretty shoddy - as soon as it stops at a floor the doors immediately open and shut to keep going, be careful). The room wasn't too bad. Decent size. Old tv, pretty visually unappealing. Bathroom was full of hairs, everywhere. Also there was a bucket under the sink to deal with a leaking pipe. I'm usually low maintenance and don't mind the occasional spot or hair, but this room just felt really dirty and gross. The bed was the worst part. Although it was a king, it was horribly uncomfortable. Worst back pain of my life in the morning. Fitness center is a joke. Although spacious, it has a treadmill and a bike, and a multi gym weight tower in the middle, that is in awful condition and all of the cables are broken. I didn't even bother working out there. Breakfast was modest. Literally ice cold pastries, watered down juices, do it yourself waffles, and reconstituted eggs. Breakfast starts at 6 and I got there at 6:30, and a kid that apparently worked there (no id/uniform) was scrambling to set everything up - I'm guessing he was late for work. Other people he was hanging out with and eating with (other employees or his friends) were also there chatting and having a good time. Very strange, I don't think they were guests, and I think it is inappropriate for the employees to be eating breakfast with guests.Again, for the price I'm really not complaining, you get what you pay for. Location isn't too bad either. Had I paid more of this was a more prestigious brand hotel, I'd be writing a letter to the CEO.
-1|Room was filthy. Staff was mediocre. Stained sheets, used medicine cups in drawer, filters full of dust and leaky shower. Place is a dump and not worth the price. Would not recommend to anyone, especially if you are traveling with kids.

The pillows were wimpy, lumpy, and worthy of the trash. The sheets were not percale, nor sateen, nor crisp cotton, instead they...
-1|Looking for an awful experience at a nasty hotel, this south Orlando Hampton in is for you.

Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else

-1|First impressions last forever. This was my first time staying at a Marriott hotel. I booked our room months in advance of our arrival date. Arrived at 4:10 p.m. and room was not ready. Took 3 people to confirm the room was NOT ready. Spent 12 mins waiting to get a room. No upgrade was offered or same style room we originally booked was offered. Was given a standard room with a 30.00 discount. The room was OK, however the beds were very small for double occupancy and way too high off the floor! No complementary Internet or coffee was offered. No free breakfast either. Do yourself a favor and book at a Hilton/Hampton hotel. You will get more amenities for a lot less . I could have stayed 2 nights at a Hilton/Hampton for what I paid 1 night for at Marriott.,
-1|This place is a Marriott but I've stayed at Courtyards that were nicer than this dump. This place should be re-branded to a lower quality Marriott Property. When I see that a property is a Marriott (and not a Residence Inn, Fairfield, Courtyard, etc) I believe it is a NICE place with HIGH QUALITY standards. This property was not that.Room was okay. Nothing special. The room was overpriced by about double for the property.Breakfast was fine, the buffet is priced similarly to other Marriotts. Coffee was average.Location is near Little Italy and the Medical school. Not an awesome part of town and the property matches the neighborhood (not awesome). It's not the ghetto but there are definitely nicer looking areas in Chicago.I will not stay here next time I'm in Chicago. It may be the closest Marriott property to my client but there's plenty of public transportation in downtown Chicago, you can stay other nicer places that aren't over-priced (I recommend Blackstone Renaissance!)
-1|Honestly, it's probably isolated with a particular staff member but I am shocked. Front desk is typically your go to person for everything you need but during my stay this is an exception. It's so ridiculous I feel odd even writing this. I ordered a pizza which has nothing to do with the hotel but after an hour and a half I call the pizza place and they say it was left at the front desk because the hotel couldn't reach me. I called the front desk and he stated he tried to call the cell and the room and talked to someone(not me) that said they didn't want the pizza. I told him we were waiting for the pizza and of course we would of answered any call to the room. His response was are you calling me a liar. I called your room and you didn't answer!! I've never dealt with any front desk staff at any hotel I've ever stayed at that was so blatantly obtuse, defensive, and mean. Maybe he was having a bad day but it's borderline childish. He told me the pizza is here come and get it. I did and it was ice cold just sitting there and he was super rude during the exchange. Horrible service.The hotel itself is nice and check in was good. Rooms are clean and overall I would be satisfied if it wasn't for this particular staff member. What a shame.
-1|I have stayed at this hotel before without any problems. I am a Marriott Platinum member, so I always get placed on the Concierge floor. This time the hotel checked me into Room 420 on the top floor. When it was time to go to bed, I found the bed to be HARD AS A ROCK. I was used to the luxurious Marriott Beds (they sell the mattresses), but this thing was impossible. It was late and I ended up sleeping on the Duvet Cover for some padding. When I reported this they said they would take care of it. The next day after work (after getting little sleep the night before), I tested the bed. Another very thin pad had been placed on the bed. I had had it. I called the Manager to come to the room and housekeeping. The housekeeper was fantastic. She knew just want to do. While she was padding my mattress I noticed something unusual. The tag on the mattress said Beauty Rest, Custom Made for Hyatt Hotels. This particular hotel had not been a Hyatt since 2003!! (And who knows how long the mattress had been there, so it was AT LEAST 10 years old). The manager explained he was sorry but that they had budgeted for new mattresses. COME ON. This hotel charges Michigan Avenue rates and is NOT close to downtown. I could not believe it. On the positive side, the host in the Concierge Lounge was incredible. The breakfast was amazing and the service was great.Finally when I checked out, I noticed an added room charge. I complained and was told I would have to come down to the desk at check out. I gave the erroneous bill to the desk staff. She looked at it and I told her which one was billed erroneously. Then she said what day is that... Good grief.. she was LOOKING at the bill. Finally just said Take the charge off now. I guess from talking to the manager that it is hit or miss whether you can a new or an old mattress. And after all, a good nights sleep is a BASIC requirement for business travel. I will not stay here again... period... obviously customer comfort is not 1.And what did I get my all this trouble 1|000 extra points. That's it, Marriott UIC.. None of my business for you!,
-1|For a place just to sleep it may be ok. But there was mold in the bathroom. It is very close to the highway but very ran down part of town. There are signs that encourage customers to lock and chain their doors but there were no chains in the two rooms we were in. Breakfast is cereal and muffins....
-1|This place needs to be reported to the health department. The check in process was awkward. There are 3 buildings one of which I think people actually live in full time. The smell of mold and mildew is I fathomable We left and ended up going all the way back home.
-1|I booked a 7 night adventure for my family thru Expedia but I had to change plans cause our dates were conflicting. I had cancel current reservation on March 21. In the info for the booking it stated no charges will be made if cancelled before April 21. I have been waiting now 10 days and no refund for deposit...

-1|I wish I had the opportunity to rate my experience at this hotel, but I never got the chance to even book my reservation.I had done a lot of resarch on hotels for my upcoming visit to San Francisco in two months, and was very pleased to find the Orchard Garden Hotel. When I did more research, I discovered in the specials section of their website that they offer a discounted rate of 149 for a superior king room when you book three consecutive nights (San Francisco Triple Play special valid through 8/31). When I clicked on this special and attempted to book my stay, however, it only offered me the room at the regular rate of 213 a night, 64 more a night!Assuming this was just an error with the website, I called the reservations desk. They couldn't explain why I couldn't book at that rate either so they transferred me directly to the hotel. The hotel staff politely explained that this rate has blackouts, and that I must have been trying to book during the blackout. The special didn't mention blackouts, and I pointed this out. The special is worded plainly and said that if space was available, the offer was valid through 8/31. No fine print, etc.- I was very careful to pay attention.Long story short, they admitted that this is used to entice customers during times of low vacancy and that the rate is only available arbitrarily, i.e., there may only be one room available at this rate on a particular date. I'm upset because it is extremely deceptive to say that a promotion is available until a certain date if space is available (which it was), and then not honor it. I asked if they would honor their special, but they said that they weren't willing to and that the higher, regular rate is the best they could do. Bottom line is that they advertise specials to interest you, then try to charge way more. As a result, I'll go elsewhere...don't waste your time trying to use one of their specials or discounts. I'm very disappointed.
-1|Didn't stay here because my meeting was postponed a week but they charged me for 1 night's stay anyway--440--because I cancelled 20 hours ahead rather than 24 which is their policy. Did they rent the room anyway Would a reputable hotel do this Shouldn't the 1 night's stay cancellation fee have been waived They refused to be reasonable. Avoid this place.
-1|The building is well located next to Union Square in San Francisco, 2 steps from Cable Car station. a Theatre occupies the first floors of the building.At the reception the staff is very standard, nothing more.Room I was given (and I was upgraded on last floor) is so old that no other word come to my mind than dirty. No Air conditioner, a fan is at your disposal on the ceiling, above the bed, and you can open the window.Bathroom is small, and especially needs to be renovated.For the same price you can leave in a much better Hotel in San Francisco.
-1|Not a very well kept place. Cockroaches had fun traveling around the room and bathroom. Owner thought it was her right to park in the handicap parking because it was convenient for her. Coffee pot did not work. Will not return.
-1|I found this hotel left a lot to be desired:, run down, poor upkeep, not so nice desk clerk. I would prob. not ever stay in this hotel again due to being run down and not well equipped. Better choices out there for the

-1|Was hesitant about this hotel after reading some of the reviews and my fears came to life as soon as we checked in. We had a room on the first floor with a kitchenette which smelled awful - evidently a souvenier from the last meal cooked there. The hotel is very outdated. I was told by the very nice desk clerk (who took me around the hotel attempting to find us another room) that they are in the process of updating Not to sure about that. Hotel is right on the strand. There is no A/C in the hallways and it appears that windows are usually kept open. We were supposed to stay two nights but left after one. Probably a great place for families on a budget with small children. Oh yeah, continental breakfast is juice boxes and poptarts basically. It is a good location though.,
-1|They were able to accommodate me at an earlier time than normal check-in. Room was clean and comfortable except for the pillows. Also, there were no bathroom amenities other than shampoo. The town was flooding and under a STATE OF EMERGENCY. The staff was scrambling to accommodate guests as best they could.,
-1|Hard to get in to property. The door handle was broke and the faucet in the bathroom was broken! The lady didn't even offer another room to shower in! Paid lot to have to go out smelling like yesterday
-1|The room had a disgusting smell, it was overall dirty, bed and pillows were lumpy and the price was too high for this type of room. Even the towels were rough and needed to be replaced. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area. I was very sorry I chose this hotel.
-1|I stayed at the Best Western for one night on business. The floor was dirty. It had not been vacuumed well. There were crumbs on the carpet. There was also what looked like the wing of a cockroach (or some kind of similar insect) on the inside of one of my folded towels. Additionally the phone did not work, so I could not use it to call out or to receive a wake-up call. I would not stay at this motel again or recommend to others.,
-1|This room was not clean. There was some red, bloody looking prints on the bathroom door. Also, the dressing and bathroom area was very un-suitable! The bathroom had a sink with no counter around it. So, all my stuff had to be some place other than where I needed them (like my contact lense items, make-up, etc. Then, when you got into the actual bathroom, there was no surface to place anything on, or any hooks to hold your towel. The room was for a handicapped person, but, even a handicapped person needs a surface to hold their towel and clothes. Even the toilet did not have a lid. So, you went in there and where was your towel and clothes to be This room was a disaster. Then, we stayed there on New Years Eve and left on New years day. We left at around 10 am. There was no breakfast. When I asked, they said that breakfast ended at 9:30 am because it was a weekday. I told them it was a National Holiday and they said that they do not celebrate or acknowledge the National Holiday of New Years day. So that was that! We were not pleased!! And will never stay there!!
-1|This was one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at, we travel a lot and have stayed at a lot of hotels. I have reviewed a lot of hotels and I rarely leave a bad review, but this was too disgusting to not address.We were moving my cousin to Orlando, and needed a late night hotel last minute. We picked the best western, in hind sight I wish we had slept in the car. We checked in around 1 am. Once we got settled in and ready for bed, we started seeing small roaches crawling out from behind the painting above our bed. My husband killed the 2 that we saw. We were a little grossed out but that late at night, we didn't have many options. The next morning we woke up to more roaches crawling around the painting. Then we saw a couple of huge ones above the TV. After seeing this we wondered how many more were in the room. We grabbed our stuff went to front desk and told them. She refunded us 50 . My husband emailed the manager STUART BLOOMBERG about this. He emailed us back and told us the exterminators came and said the room was perfectly clean and there wasn't a single roach. So either we saw the only 4 roaches in the room or someone is not being honest. My husband relayed to Stuart how grossed out we were and asked for the remainder of balance to be refunded. Stuart told us he can't do that the roaches must have entered the room when we opened the door to enter the room ourselves. At this point not only were we disgusted by the pest infested room but also insulted by the manager that he would accuse us of letting the roaches in. We are realistic, a bug here and there is normal, but a roach infested room is a sign of filth. We are so disappointed, what a waste of money, and such poor customer service. STAURT BLOOMBERG offered us 50 off on our next stay, as if we would EVER go back to that hotel. I have never left a hotel feeling this disgusted. A word of advice to the manager of this hotel, don't blame your customers for your hotels lack of hygiene. Unprofessional staff, filthy hotel, stay somewhere else.,
-1|The room was clean, only good bit. The location was good. Staff were, Staff!! The corridors were old and need of an update, dirty and smelly. There were ice and coke machines that did not work. the Air con was noisy, we were travelling around so were not here too long thank goodness. It was in general old and needed an overhaul,
-1|Traveled to Orlando for a science competition at University of Central Florida. TERRIBLE front desk service, unfriendly breakfast staff. Able to clearly hear street noise, not able to access high-speed internet despite room being close to lobby. Budget-friendly, but wished I had not agreed to staying at this property when proposed by the AAA travel agent.
-1|It may look decent outside, but the rooms are not that great. The bathroom and room smells bad. Had to buy an air freshner because it was so bad. The water smells bad too. Queen size bed and one sofa, and there's a wall barrier between bed and sofa (odd). The breakfast bar was not good. There's a pool, it's okay. And the jacuzzi was out of service. Ice machine out of service.
-1|Short Staffed - Was the only one in the lobby, waited 15 minutes for the only staff member who was on the phone trying to find a reservation in the system to cancel it for someone who just made it. The caller should have been referred to the online or national call in reservation system. The hotel was sold out - perhaps Management should have thought to have more than one person on staff until midnight perhaps Dirty Bed Linens - Once in my room, was disgusted to find that one of the beds obviously had not been changed with new sheets. - Luckily it was a double queen room and the other appeared clean. The green bed covers were filthy and torn. Will not be staying at a Best Western again. Told the agent at the front desk who apologized and removed a nominal amount off the check. Travelling on business - so that really doesn't make much of a difference to me.Noisy Air Conditioning - When the under-the-window air handler came on, it sounded like an Chevy Suburban on at fast idle.
-1|Roach in the room but the staff said its just a bug not a roach, like that made it any better. Big hole in the bathroom wall were this bug/roach came out of. Wonder what other rodent will come out of the wall.,
-1|Friday morning we were awoken by landscapers at 7:00 am. Now we are on vacation it would have been nice if they started a little later. Also, our second night our room was not made up or clean towels when we arrived back at 11pm. When we asked why at the front desk we were told because we had the Do not disturb sign on our door still at 10am. However someone was in our room because our air conditioner was shut off. The front desk staff both at night and the next morning basically did not care because we booked through Expedia and not them. The staff for the continental breakfast were so sweet polite and helpful. I enjoyed seeing them every morning.Our last night all we heard all night was a dog barking. Again the staff said Well people sneak dogs in. And then pretty much shrugged there shoulder in a not caring action.I will definitely not stay here again when I visit my daughter at school.,
-1|I made a guaranteed reservation in October for the Masters golf tournament week, which is held every year in April. As you can imagine, hotels fill up years in adance for this week, so I made sure to do this very early. SIX MONTHS after I made my reservation, I received an email from the manager Tina McCarthy saying that...,
-1|This hotel was nice and quiet. Did not know, there was train track near by. But it was only few train passed during our stay. Best Western changed hotel classification. The Plus category are not the same as before.,
-1|We stayed in the king suite with the separation between the bedroom and the living space. The sofa bed wasn't very good I had back discomfort by the day we left on our three night stay. The room is clean, and the king bed very comfortable. This hotel is located within walking distance to most places,
-1|I stayed here for three nights while I explored nearby Santa Barbara. This place is ok for a night or two, if you can live the excess noise coming from the freeway, then three nights is just about doable
-1|The water is very hot and there's no cold water at all... It's awful.. The food is not good.. The staff is friendly and very nice.. More upscale items should be offered for the price of the room at 200. A night! Snacks, toiletries, menus and food and drinks offered.. Promote your business...
-1|We recently had the opportunity to travel to New Orleans and we chose to stay at the Whitney based on user reviews, location, and price. The room was very nice and was really clean. The hotel was well decorated. The one big call out I have is that the restaurant accepts room charges and cash only! As a rule, I won't support a business that doesn't accept credit cards for payment. Valet parking or a paid lot across the street are your parking options.
-1|Nice locationGood staff Th rooms need to be Aired and to ne cleaned.Th breakfast is a shameTh location is goodWe dont recommanded this hotel as for th quality or th rooms as for the quality of th breakfast server into plastic plates
-1|If you are driving then this is for you! A bit of walk to tram and facilities.It's an old style hotel with bigger rooms that's a plus, however I would definitely check out the location next time! Breakfast selection is not a great option, it certainly a reasonable feed!
-1|First impression, I see vehicles parked tightly not only on the curved street immediately in front of this Four Points, but continuing as tight on the front end of this Four Points Hotel property up, with only a small passageway past their shuttle, to the hotel entrance. Never have I seen vehicles parked at this concentration at the front of any hotel before! Upon entering the Hotel, I see a very new hotel look and like what I see. I wait but a few minutes and then am assigned a room. Room 127, first floor. I checked in at about 9:30 PM Saturday night and that was what was available, but requested an upper floor room, if available, the following night. Duly noted.First room impression. Beautiful room so far. How do the lights work Not the usual toggle switch. No hint from the front desk about simple light operations, at all. Onward into the dark room until I get the lights on. No master switch. Every light has its own switch. Bathroom has three. Awesome bathroom with glass doors.First night room impression. HVAC works well. Not too loud. People walking down, and talking loudly, the hallway can be heard clearly ! People running or walking upstairs sound loudly. Slamming doors on every room are very loud inside my room. Screaming or running children are not silent! The sound of dripping water from from an upper level HVAC unit sound like tapping on my window tap most of the night long. Second night impression. Moved upstairs to Room 226. No more frequent travelers headed for upper levels. Same drip drip drip sound from an upper level HVAC unit dripping on my window frame, or HVAC frame. Only on screaming child in the hall about 7:30AM.The desk personnel were very simple and personal. They helped me move a room request. Parking impression. Ugly. Animal like. You gotta be kidding me. This is a Sheraton Hotel! Owners, take a look. This is not a dog race arena parking lot!Sheraton alert! Sheraton alert! Sheraton alert!,
-1|The hotel staff was friendly and engaging. The property appeared recently renovated and well kept up. You need to be prepared for the surrounding neighborhood. it's 100 feet from some of the sketchiest places you ever want to see. Not one but two strip clubs, a couple of adult bookstores and of course, the obligatory massage parlor beneath the bails bondsman. None of this is the hotels fault and I would certainly rate them higher if the neighborhood was a little nicer.
-1|I had a friend in town, so was looking for a San Diego hotel, but everything downtown/Gaslamp etc was over 300, so we decided to give this a try at 199 .. It was OK .. the room was clean, the bed was comfortable, but the walls are thin, and sounded like a herd of elephants in the room above us, early in the morning. I would suggest a higher-floor room, we were on the first floor. But, I can't say anything about the elevator situation. Don't see us needing to stay in SD again anytime soon, and there is really nothing about this property that beckons me back. Exiting the hotel parking area is hazardous, there are cars flying off the freeway, so you have to time your exit carefully!
-1|This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are quite nice. The large was extremely comfortable, but there were a few issues I experienced: - The hallways smelled of dirty wet dog. - There were outlets for charging on only one side of the King bed. - I expected liquid soap in the bathroom and shower as I've had at the last two Hamptons I've stayed at. - There is a hotel being demolished on one side of the hotel, so the construction noises started fairly early. - The breakfast buffet was extremely sub-par. The paper plates and plastic utensils were just tacky and I expected more from a Hampton. The food options were lacking, the fruit was not fresh, the eggs had an odd flavor, there were no breakfast meats at all, and the self-serve coffee was empty and when I politely alerted a staff member, I was basically ignored.,
-1|super friendly staff, average breakfast, free wifi, 16.00 per night parking, good AC in room, good bedding, average cleanliness, lots of kids, family hotel no good restaurants close by...easy freeway access better than most hotels on the circle
-1|Nice place, but.........21 to park!Wifi would drop out, every 5 minutes. Frustrating.Shower pressure sucked. Really bad.Pillows were pretty flat.Lots of freeway noise.Breakfast on Saturday morning was a zoo. Overcrowded, dirty tables, no one cleaning them, out of juice, out of eggs, pretty much out of everything. Get there early. We went down at 0930.Probably would choose someplace else when returning.,
-1|Average place , over priced and they charge you to park your car onsite.Stayed in far nicer motels for less .Small rooms. Dirty windows .I would expect more from a larger chain like this. Beds were average , bathrooms small but ok.
-1|I chose this hotel because it was close to the venue where I went to a concert, and I thought a Best Western would be nice. It was not worth the price I paid. Besides not providing breakfast or a discount coupon for breakfast at the adjoining restaurant, the room was small, the towels felt like sandpaper, and the list of television stations was incomplete.,
-1|Although the Best Western is aesthetically pleasing upon arrival, the staff in the main lobby are less than hospitable. Even though the hotel has Wi-Fi, the staff did not go out of their way to offer the code to me at check-in. The room was impeccably clean and attractive. However, the bed was not very comfortable to sleep on.
-1|we checked in around 8pm room air conditioner was not turned on room had an odor ref was unplugged we had to figure out where the socket was cant dry your hair and keep ref plugged at the same time no microwave in room or convenient place to use it in lobby
-1|This is a 1960's era resort motel, a bit out dated but comfortable and reasonably priced, convenient and with free parking. The old in room air conditioner did it's best, still struggling along as it continues to age. Front desk service was just average. TV reception was minimal we did need to have maintenance come in to get it connected. In room coffee tea is absolute minimum.
-1|Don't believe this is a 3+ star property. While the room was clean enough, the entire facility is in need of a complete renovation.We were very disappointed as we had a week reservation.My first clue that this was going to be sub-Best Western standards was the fact that their airport shuttle was unavailable for when we were arriving.I will say the hot tub was certainly hot enough and other than the foam that was created when the jets were on(add some more soda ash), was very nice.I am glad we really only slept here as we were about town for most of our stay.
-1|it was my last hotel in serious of three during 11 day trip from san francisco so i can compare to few others. the room itself was OK. 2 twin beds that were a little bit small but no surprise there. the bath was fine but the weird thing is that the sink and counter space is outside the bathroom. another weird thing is a full mirror wall on the side of the bed...the walls are very very thin. i felt like the people in the room next door were talking to me. luckily we weren't in the room most of the time but still... the hotel is an open motel kind of space which is nice and has a warm pool at night with steaming water so that's fun. the location at hotel circle is great. close to a lot of things in san diego and i don't think we drove over 1-2 exits in the highway to any of the other attractions. just across the road is the fashion valley mall with a lot of stores and good restaurants if you need to rest.
-1|For the price, around 70 a night, it was average. The room had been somewhat remodeled with new bedding, wallpaper, furniture and drapes. The rooms are very small and tight with two beds. Note that two beds will most likely be 2 doubles, not queens. The bathroom needed work, It wasn't the cleanest. Old door and moldy corners. The grounds of the motel are very nice. However, keep in mind that many temporary workers and hotel help obviously live in the motel. Ask for an upstairs room, the lower rooms are loud. And stay away from rooms across from the laundry. It has a nice pool and hot tubs. The staff was friendly. It is easy access from Interstate 8 and close to the Trolly Stop and Fashion Valley Mall.
-1|Made reservations at the last minute for New Year's eve and it was clearly 20 cheaper for similar hotels in the area. Clean, digital tv. Older style heater/air-conditioner combination controlled by a high/low thermostat rather than temp. It worked fine. Even though next to the freeway, didn't hear a thing in the room.
-1|The property is very clean including the rooms. You can't beat the location to many attractions like Balboa Park, Sea World, the beaches, and airport. The gym is a bit small and the walls to the rooms are paper thin.
-1|hotel has a fresh coat of paint since the last visit. pool area nice. great beds. small bathrooms and the faucet puts out just as much water as shower head when shower is on. very friendly staff. restaurant and bar aren't too bad. good location.
-1|First of all I want to say this was a good trip but not because of the MOTEL. We went to sea world, koby's swap meet and did a lot of shopping. The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.,
-1|The rooms were as expected from a Best Western. Nothing special, but very clean. The grounds were very well kept and had beautiful plants that it felt very tropical. Parking was near the room so very convienient, but like a motel experience where the cars are all pulled up in front of the room doors. We enjoyed our visit.
-1|I have used Best Western for business and pleasure trips. I appreciate the amenities even though the quality seems to vary depending on location. The staff have consistently tried to accommodate my needs and random dietary requests and I have appreciated the genuine desire to help my stay at BW be as comfortable as possible.
-1|Smallish room, clean, comfy bed, no cheesy bedspreads, nice pillows, decent bathroom, coffee maker, easy access from car to room, full on restaurant, pool, hot tub. Friendly fast experience front desk check in. Affordable, clean remote. Will stay here again. Dog friendly too!,
-1|This hotel was clean and easy to access after a long day of driving and playing softball. It was in a kind of run down area and the hotel is somewhat outdated but we were just looking for somewhere clean to sleep. For that reason it was great. The staff was wonderful and very polite with all directions and requested information and help.
-1|stayed here on 3/4/21012free parking, good free wy fi. good location to rental cars and airport.not during rush hour.the queen bed was the worst ever, cold shower, and hair drier did not work at 430 am.manager adjusted the bill. room was clean park in front of room.
-1|Just what you paid for, its a clean hotel. It has enough parking lot for everyone. And its close from most of the important stuff in San Diego. The rooms are not big , but enough to hold a small family
-1|Not bad for hotel circle slightly out dated but clean the restaurant isn't terrible either I guess hot tub is open 24 hours a day pretty grounds slightly inconvenient location however absolutely must have a car
-1|Close to all we wanted to see and the hotel give you a little list of direction to things that is incredibly helpful. Nothing fancy but felt comfortable. Shower pressure not great and limited hot water.
-1|It comes down to this: as usual, you get what you pay for. The hotel is older, but at least it is clean.Pros: price, location (close to everything but not too close), friendly staff, clean rooms.Cons: small rooms, doesn't feel terribly secure, noisy (thin walls), no breakfast, hard beds.
-1|This hotel is not as it once was when I started visiting it. The staff is still friendly and professional, however it stops there. The rooms are out dated. The internet is intermittent they only provide wireless service. The water pressure is low and it only ever reached luke warm. At one point it turned ice cold on me. Unfortunately, I will find it hard pressed to go back.
-1|We were very disappointed that while we made a reservation for a lower level room by the time we checked in we were forced to take a stairwell up to the second floor. We specifically asked for a lower level as my mother has bad hips and a hard time climbing stairs. The second floor would have been fine had there been an elevator at least, but there was not which resulted in us hauling her luggage up for her so she wouldn't fall. We were very displeased by this to start with, but what added insult to injury was the extremely rude nature of the check in receptionist.
-1|I stayed here for 2 days and it was a nice place to stay. The room offered a mini fridge and coffee pot. The room was small but it was only me and I was there just for sleeping. The room was neat and clean when I arrived and while I stayed. I had a ways to walk to get to my room and it was dark so the map that they gave me didn't help much. The air conditioner was a bit noisy so if you are a light sleeper it will bother you if you run it at night. The window does open but it is on the walkway side of the room. There are two hot tubs on the property and a pool. I ate at the cafe on the property and it was very good. They DO NOT offer airport transportation but I got and Uber for about 4.
-1|Don't let the Priceline or Hotwire star rating fool you. This is NOT a 3 star hotel. This is an older hotel with wear and tear that makes this more of a 2 star hotel. The last time this place was renovated was (I'm guessing) more than 10 years ago. Tell me, how clean do you expect 10 year old carpet to be The lack of an in-room microwave and no poolside towels are two notable deficiencies. Most Best Western's provide some sort of a breakfast but this place does not. Having said that, the location in Mission Valley is very convenient and when you factor in free parking and discount pricing (from Hotwire / Priceline)... this place is actually a decent value. A Crown Jewel in the Best Western Empire IT IS NOT... but for a short stay at a convenient place in San Diego with free parking, the discount price may offset some of the limitations.
-1|All in all I like this hotel. I stay here every time I am in San Diego for business. Front desk staff unfriendly . rooms are clean. The pool is nice. I wish they midnight curfew for Jacuzzi but unfortunately the Jacuzzi is 24 hours and people can be loud at times
-1|This is a frustrating hotel it's OK, but with minimal effort it could be so much better.The basic amenities are fine the room was clean the wifi and TV worked, and the bar was open. All good, rightNo...upon check-in, they add a 75 block to your credit card, and say it'll stay from 5-7 business days. That's outrageous, and when I asked why, was told people steal TV's from the rooms. If so, 75 doesn't cover a replacement (and they should rent to better people!). Short-sighted for them I was going to book another night a few days later, but learned they'd block an additional 75...this is building customer loyaltyOn check-out, a guest was complaining that she had no hot water for 3 days...the front desk clerk's attitude was 'management cut back on maintainance. Lovely. Worse, the morning shuttle I'd booked and they reconfirmed the night before was cancelled as the van driver decided to help a family load suitcases into the van......at which point to desk clerk called me a taxi and had the hotel pay for it - a VERY generous gesture!Like I said, a difficult review to write. I wonder if management knows just how hard it's employees work to keep the customers happy
-1|I am being nice rating this place average, this hotel is stuck in the 70s as far as decor, the room noise from room to room is bad, everytime your neighbor open and closed thier door it felt like they were in your room, not good.,
-1|I stayed here for one night in a single queen room. The room was very small and dated. The worst part of this property is how thin the walls are. You can hear every conversation that your neighbors are having as well as anytime the toilet is flushed, shower is on, door is open/closed etc. If you are only looking for a cheap place to stay this may suit your needs but there are many better options in hotel circle (even for the same price).
-1|The grounds are dimly lit at night and it is hard to find your room at night. The room numbers are too small to read and not reflective so impossible to see. Parts of the parking lot are narrow and hard to drive your car or back out of your spot without the possibility of hitting a structure or landscaping or planter. The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out. I checked in on a Friday night. The extra charges came off when I checked my account again on Tuesday. An inconvenience if you are on a tight budget and using a debit card. Overall the grounds were well kept and the room was clean, but had poor appliance, electrical outlet and furniture placement. No elevator for 2nd floor rooms.
-1|My husband and I drove into SDiego after a 7 1/2 hour drive. (Avoid Hwy 5 if you're coming in from up north. Tons of roadwork). Anyway, the staff was friendly and quick to serve us. It was 2am so there wasn't a line. But it was great to have keys in hand within less than 7 minutes. My issue with this place have to do with:1) no parking 2) how my husband and I had to walk from one end of the parking lot to the other end to get to our room. (I'm pregnant btw, to give you more context). It seemed like there were way too many cars for the number of rooms.3) The bed sufficed though it was hard. We both passed out so it didn't matter too much. 4) The AC worked. But it sounded like the people upstairs were running the shower all morning. 5) There is no tub. It's a stand in shower like in gyms. Not that that mattered to me. But water got all over the floor and you may want to bring sandals to stand in. I have a Best Western rewards card. So I stayed here to earn points. But, note to self: won't be staying here for an extended stay. Can't say I'd recommend it to others.
-1|This hotel could use a remodel. The rooms are very run down. Thankfully the beds are comfortable. They had a broken light plate switch on the mirrored wall that my toddler started to play with and we quickly had to shue her away from and block. The tub wouldn't hold water for a bath for my kid. The thing that made me the most angry was they didn't provide microwaves. When I called about it they said I could pay an additional 10.99 a night for a microwave. Are you kidding me Obviously this is a scam to force you to eat at their cafe restaurant. I walked down the street instead and ate at the Burger Bunz restaurants..great food.
-1|The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the hotel itself is a hit or miss.Upon arrival, the room was very small, crowded, outdated uncomfortable. Not what you would expect from a BW Plus hotel.We unpacked most of our stuff and went for dinner, only to come back to discover the bathroom had not been cleaned and there was urine and pubic hairs on the floor. I was extremely grossed out and could not use the bathroom.The TV box was also missing so we could not use the TV.I contacted the front desk girl and she was able to switch us to a different (and bigger) room that had been renovated, and was clean so that was a huge relief. She was able to do this even though it was close to midnight.The TV box was stolen from the new room as well (these must be popular in the USA...lol), but the great maintenance man was able to get one from another room and install it the next day for us.The hotel itself was very close to lots of activities, so the location is good, but if you want a nicer room, go with 2 queens or a king.
-1|This hotel Does Not provide shuttle service it is advertised on Trip Advisor as provided but is inaccurate please update as it cost money to take a taxi shuttle or ride share. The hotel is a good value nothing fancy but clean, the staff was friendly. The restaurant is adequate again nothing fancy but the food was good, we had the French dip and chicken noodle soup. Would stay again but prefer accommodations with airline shuttle service.
-1|The front desk staff needs an introduction to providing better customer service they do what they think their job is, but without any real consideration for the guest in front of them. The room smelled strongly of cleaner enough to make my eyes water. The two control knobs on the A/C unit were broken and amateur repaired so that they did not work. The soap in the bath, down to a sliver, was not replaced. The coffee supplies were not replenished and the waste basket not emptied. They allow people to wander around the facility slipping flyers for other restaurants under the doors not a warm feeling for security awareness. The Cafe served an excellent breakfast good food and excellent friendly staff. I'd suggest you do not pay the up-charge to get breakfast 'included' in the room cost. You can get a good breakfast at the Cafe for much less than the higher room rate, and, if you want to go somewhere else, there are dozens of other restaurants in walking distance. Next time, I'll try a different hotel chain and walk over to the BW Cafe for breakfast.,
-1|We stayed for two nights and chose this location because it was close to things we wanted to do. My first issue is the parking and there's not enough spaces. We had a suite that had a closed off living room but the AC unit was in that room and so even with the door open the rest of the room was hot. There was fan on wall but it was so loud you couldn't talk. The room was very small, so much that only one person could fit between the tv and bed. The shower was horrible. The temp never stayed the same. The doors into the building and the elevators were barely functioning. The pool was dirty and the surrounding area. Breakfast was okay. The staff was not very friendly or accommodating. We have never been to CA and so we had a lot of questions and the staff acted like it was such a burden to answer them. Overall I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't let my friends or family go either. ,
-1|Ok people, before the bashing begins just remember you are paying roughly 129/night and you get free WiFi and a hot breakfast to boot. All in an area where it usually runs 200+/night. You get what you want to pay for it. You will not get Hilton like amenities at this kind of deal.First the good:1) Great location, right off the freeway, 2 min from a huge shopping mall and plaza with everything under the sun to eat at. 10 min from Seaworld or Gaslamp or Qualcomm.2) Good breakfast, decent choices, some healthy items, coffee is good.3) Fridge and microwave in the rooms. AC works nicely. The bed was good, with a lot of pillows, which I believe they just switched out to new ones.4) Friendly staff at front desk. Now the not so good, or you get what you pay for:1) The pool is loud when active until 10pm. The rooms face the pool in an L shape, it echoes through the halls. If no one is there, then it is fine. During summer, it's brutal.2) The rooms do need updating. You can see it is a work in progress, but the walls in my rooms were all marked up, the decor was outdated. Hallways and elevator showed heavy signs of use. Pocket door for bathroom was very heavy and loud. One telephone didn't work, etc. Our blackout drapes were torn and pulling away from the window, so it did not stop much light during the day for my son's naps.3) Thin walls. We heard every footstep above us, every creak. We also heard everything in the halls, and with the outdoor floors you can hear everything rolling on it, or people walking through. Once asleep, not a bother.4) 8 parking fee. Whatever, it is stated on the website. Just add it to the room rate and call it free, makes the customer feel better and not nickel and dimed.5) Ant attack in our room, but they did remedy quickly when we notified. 6) The sofa bed was a joke. 7) Elevator would take us to level 3 when we pressed level 2. All day, until I told them about it.Look, this place is ok. You get good value for the rate you pay, which is cheap. It is obvious the manager is doing a lot of damage control here on TripAdvisor by trying to respond to all complaints, which reflects why the ranking for this hotel is so low, as there are a lot of complaints.Would I stay here again with family Probably not. But for a cheap room, and if I was by myself maybe. But not for my family, there were too many annoyances, but we walked out of there for under 300 total for two nights. Good luck people. But don't nail the resort for not being like Hilton when you are only paying 129/night ok!
-1|The TV and refrigerator was not working. Excellent customer service to fix the problem. The location is close to restaurants and shopping mall. Free breakfast was great with fresh fruit, eggs, sausage , cereals,patties, yogurt, pastries,waffle maker. Parking fee12. The room was clean, room had 2 separate sleeping areas which was nice. Room had 1 bed and the other area had bunk beds. Good fir 4 people. Looking for a less expensive hotel this place will be fine in San Diego.
-1|Very unique room configuration especially if you are a family. Doors open to the outside which all face inward to the open courtyard. First section or the room is your main bed, tv, mini fridge and microwave, then the second section separated by a siding interior door is a bunk bed, chest and tv then the back section of the room is the full bath. The bath area looks like it was updated at some time and is nice, staff has plenty of soap, shampoo, coffee and towels stocked. Staff was in the process of replacing all mattresses in the main beds of all rooms while I was there, in fact mine was being replaced as I checked in. Parking can be tough if the hotel is full especially if you drive a big car or truck. Exterior is in need of maintenance. Breakfast was plentiful and the normal Comfort Suites breakfast. Wifi was good. One thing that really disappointed me was the lack of many channels available on the TV. Had network channels, a couple of independent channels, did have Fox News but didn't work the last day I was there. No other news channels.
-1|Hotel is ok , but need upgrades in the rooms, the carpet, t.v. Is small the bathroom can use up grade tike in floor. When you call front desk and tell them someone right next to you is smoking and you are allergic to smoke. Accommodate me by offering another room, and not say ok and we will check it out. ,
-1|I anticipated this resort having interior corridors like the pictures led me to believe however it did not. The rooms were very old and definitely could use some updating and refurbishing. Outside the hotel a group of homeless people were staying by the emergency exit which did not make me feel safe at all. Not my first choice next time I'm in San Diego.
-1|The Comfort Suites Mission San Diego was clean and the property was pleasant. 1. The pool area never got cleaned, towels and trash laid around all weekend.2. The hot tub was broke. Never saw anyone attempting to fix it.3. We asked for extra towels, the House Keeping staff knocked once then just walked right in. I thought this was odd, unprofessional and totally inappropriate. 4. House Keeping was already trying to clean our room at 8:00 am in the morning. I thought this was odd, totally inappropriate.5. I was disgusted that people were walking into the breakfast room with no shoes, adults and children alike. Not the Hotel's fault just an observation.
-1|Arrived on a Sunday afternoon. Hotel Staff was nice upon greeting. Asked me to upgrade to a King with 2 bunk beds, but I kept the 2 double beds.The label of suite means an extra sitting room in the front with a sofa, small desk, TV, refrigerator, and microwave. The extra room made it nice for our little boy to play while we are resting in the bedroom.AC design is peculiar. Front room gets the main AC, then the room with beds is blocked by a glass sliding door. There is a fan which pulls the AC through to the bedroom. Bathroom was clean, but had a chemical smell. Carpet, wallpaper, and paint all look like they need remodel, which on the hotel website said was going to happen soon. Sliding door to bathroom does not have a lock. Nice to have 2 flat screen TVs. Bed was comfortable.We had a room in the back of the hotel, which made it quiet. The bathroom window faces a bunch of apartments, so you need to remember to close it for your privacy.Price was economical. I read the fine print about the 12 parking fee, I don't think is a big deal. However, they should create a line item in their billing before they quote the nightly price.Breakfast room was convenient and food was well stocked. I would consider going back to this hotel after the renovation. I hope they redo the AC system instead of relying on an old-fashioned fan to re-distribute the air.,
-1|We paid quite a bit to upgrade to a suite. Basically, it's a long narrow room with a divider between the window and the bed. The actual bedroom is very small and the sitting area is even smaller. The A/C is in the sitting area and you must keep the door open to allow cool air to flow into the bedroom. The additional daily parking fee exasperated the problem. The hotel sits next to the interstate but the noise did not seem to bother us once we were inside the room. The breakfast which was included was more than adequate.,
-1|You couldn't ask for a better price for a for a suite with three small rooms that includes breakfast. The total amount of space seemed similar to an Embassy Suite with parents sleeping in one room and two kids in a bunk bed in a second room that you need walk through to get to the bathroom. It is true that the AC was kind of moldy smelling and the room did feel a bit run down and the guests, in general, didn't seem real classy. The immediate location isn't exactly romantic either, but it is well located for driving places in San Diego. The breakfast, by the way, was surprisingly good. If you are used to decent hotels, it will be hard to feel comfortable at this one, and I don't think you would choose this place for a honeymoon. Still, for around 100, I don't think you could find a better value for a quick overnight stay in a suite for a family of four
-1|The location was perfect, close to Sea World since that was where we were headed. Lots of restaurants on University avenue just a mile from the hotel. Parking was convenient and free.We booked the suites since we were 5 of us. The beds were comfortable ( though I found them a little soft ). Still had a good nights rest. The bedrooms and the living room had a partition. Chairs table and a work station were in the living room. Our room overlooked the jacuzzi.The faucet in the bathroom definitely need work. It was tricky to figure out warm and cold since they worked in oopposite directions. Once we got it it was easy. I found the bathroom tiles like those found in a garden. had to use my slippers as they really hurt once out from the bath tub. We asked for the sheets not be changed. Liked their way of saving the environment. Requested for the towels to be changed.I wish the management had extra soaps since there were 5 people staying in the suite. We didnt have the time to go and request this.. We always carry some incase of instances where there aren't any. Breakfast was rrealy really good.. sausages, 2 types of eggs, cold and hot breakfast. There were tables and chairs inside as well as outside. Lots of place to sit. When depparting i needed some hot water. Couldnt find any in the coffee area, so the front desk requested the breakfast room door to be opened to assist my request. Thought this was really nice. Will definitely stay here again even though we found some glitches here and there. The price for the 2 night stay was perfect.,
-1|This is my second stay at this location and due to it's price of under 100.00 it fits my budget. On my first stay the room was spotless, unfortunately this time around I can see that they just ripped out the old TV's because there is particle board shaving from the entertainment center all over the furniture and part of the carpet...the good news is brand new flat screen..the bad news is that the front desk told me that there were no remote controls for the new HDTV's and you could not change the channels...it was programmed on the welcome screen. So the rooms are worn with sagging couches nicked and torn wall paper, old furniture and brand new HDTV's that are useless...I think I'll look elsewhere on my next business trip to San Diego. I am a Platinum Choice Hotels member and stayed over 25 nights with Comfort Suites across the Western US last year and this is not the standard of every other CS I have stayed at..this should be a Comfort Inn.
-1|As with most Mission Valley area hotels, the location is good.The rooms are very aged. Definitely time for some refurbishing (which I think is happening soon). The morning breakfast is pretty nice with a good variety of foods for everyone.Parking is pretty tight if you get there late. Parking in the back is really hard with a larger vehicle. As with other Mission Valley hotels, not sure why they charge for parking other than adding on some extra bucks to their pockets. If you are family looking for included breakfast and don't mind roughing it just a bit, this is the place for you, if you can get a good rate.,
-1|The room was not bad and it was a family room with two separate rooms. The refrigerator did not work and we had to call maintenance. He didn't fix it but we ended up fixing it- because it was wired up weird. We had fans in the room but there was no place to plug them in which was a little strange. There was an open granola bar left on the floor from the last guest that I guess housekeeping missed a couple of days in a row. The hotel was not a bad price but was still not really worth the price we paid. Breakfaste was average and very crowded every morning.
-1|Comfort Suite Mission Valley was in a great location for our plans. Housekeeping did a terrific job keeping the room clean and comfortable. The building needed some work especially on flooring by the second story stair case. Parking was definitely limited and we were unaware of a parking fee per day until checking in, that really hit a nerve. Despite that we really enjoyed our stay and the comfort it provided.,
-1|I recently stay at this hotel the weekend before Thanksgiving, and I had a few problems. I believe the best way for a hotel to do better is to let them know whats wrong. Overall I thought the hotel was nice and the staff was very helpful and this is good. There were a few hiccups, but I would probably stay again. (only if they fix the problems below)When I arrived Saturday afternoon, after my 4 hour drive, I really wanted to sit in the hot tub. I was told that it was not open due to some maintenance that needed to be done on both the pool and hot tub. I then tried to go into the hot tub the next morning and again was told it was not open and that it might be open later in the afternoon. I came back Sunday evening and it was raining, but the hot tub was finally open. So I sat in there while the rain came down and hit my face (not good and not long). Next I noticed the hotel had very nice flat screen T.V.'s in all the rooms that my family occupied. There was also HBO booklets next to the T.V.'s....only one problem. They did not have HBO or premium channels until the following weekend.. So I had to sit in a room with basic cable and no HBO or even the FX or History Channel. The breakfast was ok, but after the 2nd day I ate off site. The eggs were really watery and the sausage was as dry as beef jerky. The Orange Juice machine seemed to get worse each day, and on my third day it was like orange water. The elevator was extremely slow, and I think I could have walked up to my third floor faster. The elevators needed to be faster.
-1|Our room was extremely cramped and the hotel is in need of TLC. I can tell that the hotel is making serious strides towards improvement and the staff is seriously the highlight of the entire stay. They are wonderful and made us feel welcome during our entire stay. Besides the cleanliness factor in both the room and common areas, my biggest complaint is the bathroom has no countertop space. I love my toiletries and styling products and there was no place to put either. I ended up almost catching the room on fire because there is no counter space or even an edge of the sink in which to put my curling iron. I dropped my curling iron several times on the floor and it fell into the toilet at one point (hence the sparks and almost fire).,
-1|I always have a free bed in SF, so paying for a hotel bed seems odd, but I was here on business. If you've already committed to spend SF hotel money to stay near attractions, this isn't a bad spend.Pros: location - the Powell St. cable car ends two blocks away from you on the opposite corner of the block of buildings you would be in. Theaters and museums are mere blocks away. Bed - my goodness was this bed comfortable. I don't sleep well on most hotel mattresses, but I did here - which is good because I was here for a week! Wifi - complimentary and pretty good from my room. They have accessible rooms - which oddly enough I got, though I don't need it. Refrigerator in the room! Victory for me. I have medical needs for one, hate shelling out extra, and it is also convenient for keeping fresh fruit and other items cool so I don't have to shell out for the overpriced, less-than-great breakfasts nearby. Individual climate control - it does actually get hot in SF on occasion. The air conditioning did its job.Cons: location - there is a nightclub across the street and these windows don't appear to be double-glazed! They DO have ear plugs in the rooms and I was asked at check in if I needed a street-side or interior room. I was not facing the nightclub, but still got noise when the restaurant downstairs took out the trash at late/early hours. Age. This property IS renovated, but its age shows in spots, like in the wiring that's on the wall instead of behind it and closets that are ridiculously small. Air conditioning is by unit in the window. Some people don't like this (I do). Housekeeping: they didn't seem to want to replace things in the bathroom (i.e. washcloths, not soap) and the toilets are dual flush. Even full flush doesn't... um... always do the job. Ahem. Also, the panhandlers will be waiting for you. Don't head west on some of the nearby streets (esp Eddy). That is the Tenderloin. If you are looking for what the Tenderloin has to offer, well, then go ahead.The list of cons is longer, but I find fault easily - take it for what its worth. There is a popular restaurant attached to the hotel. I did not eat there (spendy), but it attracted a solid crowd in a neighborhood with a lot of competition. There are, of course, a ton of delicious places nearby and it is also around the same corner to the Powell St. Muni/Bart stations. If I came to SF for business again, I would consider staying here eventhough my worksite was not nearby.,
-1|Our stay was good though not without issues. We found first a very small room one that fits a lonely kid. Then it was changed to a larger one, which yet was too small for a couple. Then we changed the third time - this time we received a comfortable suit. Overall, the hotel is old a far from meeting standards of current architecture and design. This has to do with everything, from bed to lights, from toilet to size. Staff was very friendly and helpful and tried the best to fulfill our (rather modest) requests.,
-1|Positives: around the corner from the Hyde-Powell cable car turnaround, although the lines can be lone there. Great happy hour at the hotel bar, best deals on Monday and Tuesday with a terrific bar staff. Walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf and ATT Park.Negatives: dated rooms, moldy bathroooms, limited storage, noisy on occasion, missed wake up calls, car valet delays.,
-1|We felt very welcome when we arrived. The room was way to small. Probably won't stay at this location again because of the room size. Also the water pressure in the shower was awful. Felt like the price didn't match what we recieved. The staff was exceptional and very helpful.
-1|Our family of 4 stayed for two nights after Xmas. Pros: good room size, convenient location (close to cable car terminal muni), reasonable price. Cons: street noise (garbage trucks were heard for a long time during the night), upstair noise (footsteps, probably due to the age of the building), and not so warm front desk.
-1|Good location, very small, clean room in a no frills hotel. I booked a queen but they put us in a double. Lots of street noise as it's only a 4 story hotel. Worse 3 mights of sleep we have had in sometime. id you can see past a downtown, non-resort hotel charging a resort fee, then go ahead and book. Me, I can't so will avoid. My 125 turned into 158( plus usual taxes.) Just tell me upfront
-1|It is a real city hotel. Small but neat room. No view. No refill coffee but when you ask you will get it.Breakfast you pick up and its in a little bag and not very special. But the location is perfect! When you come by car you better park a few blocks away, not such a fine neighborhood but half the price.,
-1|We stayed 4 nights. There were three of us so the third person had a sofa bed in the lounge area. The good things were the location, free wifi and the staff seemed nice. We asked for a quiet room when we booked and so glad we did. It meant no view but we slept well. It is a bit dated and there was a very odd smell to the room. Only one lift in use throughout our stay. Overall it did the job with no frills. Next time I think I'll go for something newer or with character. The lobby area seemed new and really smart, it didn't match the rooms.
-1|Suite was small. It was on the highest floor. The roof top must have faulty drainage. When it rained heavily, water drops beat on the case housing the air conditioner as if someone was beating a drum.,
-1|I was little worried about Hotel Abri at first. Its prices were much less than surrounding hotels which made me skeptical. However, immediately upon arrival, it was obvious that the hotel was just fine. The gift bag at check-in was a nice touch (especially the full-size bottle of whine). I had read the reviews and read about the gift bag, but I just assumed it included it one of those little whine bottles and a few other things. The room was small, but not any smaller than I would have expected for what was most likely an old apartment building turned hotel room. And definitely no smaller than 90 of the apartments you'd see in Manhattan. Despite the size of the room, it was well-appointed and had a decent size bathroom and shower. The rooms had window AC/heat units, but they were thermostatically controlled, which was nice (instead of just being a thru-wall unit with a speed knob. The morning breakfast bag left a lot to be desired (as compared to a standard continental breakfast), but it was better than nothing. They also give you coupons to the restaurant that connects to the lobby. We didn't get the chance to eat there, but it looked nice. Anyhow, there wasn't anything overwhelmingly fantastic about the hotel, not was there really anything bad. It was a nice launching bad for our activities for a long weekend. We walked to ATT Park for the Giants game (not far), and the cable car stop was only a few blocks away (as well as all of the shopping). Likewise, Enterprise retail car was just one block away (this came in handy because we rented a car to drive to Sonoma). All in all, a good experience, decent hotel, helpful and kind staff we would stay here again Fo Sho!
-1|Hotel Abri has a good friendly team of front desk staff and a simply trendy lobby that gave me a good impression to start. The room is small and only minimally functional for a group of four (I should've checked the footage before I booked a double room for four). We had a street-facing room so it was really really noisy at night given the frequent ambulance, passengers and especially the construction noise that went beyond midnight (I didn't know that construction was allowed after 11pm in SF). Service and notes in the room were a bit confusing and inconsistent. There was no introduction pamphlets describing services of the hotel, no sign in the room stating that the water bottles weren't free. Out of my four night stays, one night I did not have enough towels, one with water not replenished, and another without any coffee/tea replenished in the room. Other minor inconvenience include not having hand soap provided, and the hotel does not have shoe horns to lend out. At the end I would still give this hotel a positive vote given their friendly front desk service and convenience of location.
-1|5 years ago it was a much better option ,they still charge high prices and have not nvested much .Definetely need refurbishment and / or they should be charging much lower .Attitude of reception is unacceptable , some of the consierge is OK , other services ( vale - breakfast... ) is not in accordence with 5 star hotel !!!
-1|The hotel has a central location and we stayed here in October 2011 (room 301), therefore we booked again this year. Some upgrades are required such as the Wifi which was very slow or did not work at all(room 601). The beds are very comfortable, but the technical standard is not in accordance with the high room rate. Shower system should be changed in order to save high water consumption (general water restrictions in California).Nice staff
-1|Booked online without taking proper account of location which is in an area which is looking rather tired and feels a bit downmarket. Reception area was undergoing some refurbishment. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.Stay was okay and room basic and comfortable but would not want to stay so far from Union Square on next visit
-1|We booked a 2 queen bed room and were given one with 1 queen bed which seemed like a dungeon. The room looked out onto a brick wall on the ground floor at the back of the hotel - it was awful, very depressing. Asked to be moved and got a lovely room at the front of the hotel on the 6th floor. Apart from that the hotel was good. A bit of a walk to the centre but not too bad. The staff very very helpful and friendly.,
-1|I was looking forward to giving this hotel an amazing review, but I can't our last night was the worst! I'll start with the good. Good:Check-in we were greeted by Sean. He has his customer service skills down! He was always friendly and willing to help. He told us how to work the shower. This saves people time so they don't have to call asking how it works. Easy to work, but I would not have known how to use it right away. So pay attention! He was able to put us in a room before check-in time (Which is at 3pm) we arrived around 11am. So everything was fine in our room. Something to note: when people close their doors its loud. There was noise in the night when sirens went by. But it was okay because our room was towards the back. Its location helps in that there isn't that much traffic so its less noisy than a hotel closer to Market St. (Our first trip to SF we were right off Market and we had to use earplugs) Free WiFi. One of the big reasons we chose this hotel was because it came with a mini fridge. We were able to store our food and water in there. Bad:On our last night I had just finished flossing and was throwing it away. I was leaning to spit into the sink as I am doing this a big cockroach is climbing out. This freaked me out and I screamed there's a cockroach. My sister who I am sharing a room with tells me to call the front desk. I do and ask if they have RAID or a bug spray he says no that he would send someone up. A man comes up I tell him where I saw it. He checks the whole bathroom and doesn't find it. I ask again if they have a spray he says no and says something about how they don't have those here (Meaning they don't have cockroaches). Then as he didn't find it he says what threw me over the edge You know your eyes can play tricks you. When he said that to me I just stared at him boiling inside and didn't say anything. After he said that I told my sister I was not going to speak to him anymore. To make a customer question what they saw and make them feel like they are crazy is just wrong. This upset me more than the cockroach. He told us to calm down and he said again that your eyes play tricks on you. My sister responded by saying she believes me and he proceeds to say if we want to change rooms in a tone you could hear he was getting mad/irritated by the situation. My sister informs him that it is our last night plus we were already in our pajamas ready to sleep (this all took place 11pm-12pm) really late. So my sister decides we sleep with the lights on. I don't know when my sister decided to dim them. But like an hour later my sister wakes up and she spots it near our bed. She tells me to call again. This time I reached for my glasses and my phone first. Ready to take a picture because the man did not believe me the first time. The cockroach went back to the bathroom and my sister followed it and watched where it would go. I called they sent the same man and he came in and my sister told him where it was. He then said he got it and said sorry and that his supervisors would not be happy. I didn't say anything to him. This took place at like 1-2 in the morning. We didn't sleep well which sucked because we had to catch our flight that morning. I'm giving them an average rating because everything was fine until that last night...
-1|Although this hotel could use a new coat of paint (which it appears they plan on doing in the new year), our room was clean, quiet, comfortable and inexpensive. I think the age of the hotel added to its charm and set it apart from most of the hotels I generally stay in - giving it character. It was definitely unique and the staff was very nice. They even upgraded our room upon our arrival. I definitely recommend this place if you want a location that is relatively close to downtown/union square without paying for the price of a downtown/union square hotel.
-1|I want to like the Vertigo Hotel. It's quaint. It's charming. It's off the beaten path. And its staircase has a Hitchcock movie connection. It is one of many renovated small hotels in San Francisco. I like boutique hotels. While it's several blocks from Union Square, I easily walked it. Its a bit closer to the Tenderloin and I suppose the nearby grittiness adds to the charm. It's a neighbourhood hotel, not in the middle of the city and touristy madness. The staff know the area and make good suggestions for restaurants and things to do.With respect to usability, especially for business, it leaves a lot to be desired. The wifi is slow. It is shabby and worn. At one point the Orange in the lobby was bright and modern. Now it is faded. Check in includes instructions on how to use the shower because it is not obvious. The website says parking is available but fails to mention it is either expensive valet or several blocks away. In the final analysis, while adequate for business, it is better suited for visitors on holiday. I am glad to have had the experience of staying there, but will probably choose another hotel for my next visit. And yet it remains charming.,
-1|This hotel is conveniently located near downtown Seward, Alaska shops, the waterfront, Aquarium, eating establishments (and bars)! It is a good place to stay -- the staff is friendly and helpful and our room was fine. The bed was comfortable. We had stayed at this hotel on previous visits and knew it was where we wanted to stay on this...,
-1|West Bank Inn is a nice motel with large beds, a bathroom that works and an average selection of complimentary breakfast products. Nothing fancy, but you cant expect more for the rate. Take a stop, have a good sleep and move on.
-1|First, I didn't expect much more for this price, it was clean and that is my number one concern! Bed was a little hard for us, parking limited, breakfast limited, but fair accommodations for the 50 ish price. Staff was nice.
-1|My husband and I stayed at The Ocean Lodge for two nights this spring, looking for some much needed downtime. On first arriving, we were certainly pleased with our choice. The welcome we received at check-in was wonderful, with a crackling fireplace going in reception....
-1|My partner and I booked this hotel expecting a high-end luxury experience. What we found was a rather worn and tattered, rock-n-roll hotel with a dated atmosphere. The room was clean, but again, a little worn. The service was okay, but our room was not ready when we arrived a bit early, but we were told it would not be ready for over an hour AFTER check-in time. We were able to check our bags at the desk, and we went for an early cocktail, but chose another place once we saw the kind of seedy bar. Room service was quick, but the food was just average. I have a feeling this outpost of the W brand is in for a major shakeup. The price of rooms here is high, and I just don't see why. We also stayed at the Hyatt Olive 8, and the experience was MUCH better. I would skip the W Seattle. You will not get what you pay for.
-1|The rooms were functional but not of the W quality I'd expect. I'm a SPG gold member and was treated nicely and had complimentary drinks but I doubt I'd stay at this property again. its close to the trains and is walkable to pike market but that's all I can say for the hotel. They need any/better art work on the walls. A little texture could help too. I'm not an interior designer or anything close but I know I can do better.
-1|Spectacular lobby and very friendly staff. Good bar and attentive service and they mix a damn fine martini. If you're looking for any sort of view at the end of the day - take a 3 block walk to the waterfront and enjoy - because there's not a view to be had from your room.(we had 6 people there in all different rooms) It is a great location - close to most of the best spots in Seattle. The rooms are comfortable, but not worth the non-corporate rates. I would have been embarrassed to charge breakfast on my corporate card because it was so overpriced. So avail yourself to one of the many coffee shops.,
-1|Note! If you drive a short box truck regular size you cannot valet! They said our truck was too back and told us to go to self park. Didn't offer to take our bags. 60 per night parking! We self parked next door for 39 per night and lugged our luggage down stairs. Front desk didn't care and they booked us in 2 doubles instead of one king. She upgraded us for 20 bucks. The corner rooms are cool! Robes, mini bar and lots of Windows. Rooms are great. Comfy bed. Cool lounge in hotel. Happy hour wine is 6 between 4-7. But service there was not that great either. Too bad. Nice stay just service could improve,
-1|We'd stayed in this hotel about ten years ago, when it was very hip happening. Now, not so much. Still, the room was fine, the bedding good, and the cleanliness what you'd expect for a higher end hotel. Not sure what's up with the very loud air conditioning, though. Even on its lowest fan setting, the noise level was so high that my husband and I had to raise our voices to be heard. Overall, an okay experience in a hotel that used to be much more than okay.
-1|I absolutely agree that the location is great. You can take the Metro from the airport, get off at the Westlake Center and walk three blocks to the hotel. Convention Center is 2 blocks away. Here are the pluses and minueseROOMI upgraded to a King view room. Suppose to be a nicer room on the 24th floor or above. The room was the exact same room with the exact same view as a friend had on the 21st floor. What I will say is the bathroom is fabulous. Soaking tub and separate shower, large vanity, robes. But the quality and quantity of the towels didn't live up to the rest of the bathroom. FACILITIESThere is no restaurant, no bar, nothing. There is a Starbucks around the corner. Its very odd given that the hotel has a small conference center. There is a Ruth and Chris' Steak House next door but the bar there is very small. And a major downside is that the lobby smells of cooking meat from about 3:00 on.Great work out facility. One of the best I've seen.Executive lounge is okay but doesn't have the amenities of Hilton, marriott, Westin etc. BREAKFASTWe had a AAA package that was suppose to include a full breakfast. It turned out to be that a very small continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge with an additional chaffing dish of eggs and a meat CUSTOMER SERVICEIt was okay during the stay but had major trouble with my bill. I got charged 3x the room upgrade. I called in to customer service and told that I was mistaken on the cost of the upgrade and that there was no way I could have gotten information to the contrary because it would mean a flaw in the reservation system. Fortunately, I still had a copy of the e-mail that showed the correct amount. When I sent it in I did not get an apology or anything even though I explained how challenging it was to have to deal with credits etc. with my company. Still waiting for the credit to show up on my card.
-1|I am more accustomed to staying at Park Place Hyatt's than Grand Hyatt's so I had to adjust my expectations. With that said, the lobby is nicely designed as are the rooms. But half of the hotel has bad views regardless of what floor you are on. A few times we requested extra towels and a few other items like laundry service and each time the staff promptly helped. That was appreciated. So was the quick check in. The rooms are a little tight but the furniture, especially the bed was comfortable. The towels in the bathroom do not know the meaning of soft and that was a bit disappointing. I am highly attuned to smells and the room was overwhelmingly fragrant upon arrival. This is something that I could have done without. As is the ridiculous fee for the wi-fi. In this day age it is insulting when a hotel charges for this service. It feels like they ought to charge to use the alarm clock while they are at it. If it were not for the Internet charge I would give this hotel a 4-star rating. But the charge feels like a thorn in my side so they get a 3-star rating.
-1|The hotel is alright. It serves the purpose for sleeping. They don't have a bar, they recommend Ruth Chris Steakhouse for every food or drink need you might have!There was something in the air in the room that was allergic to me. I was fine once i left the room. I am allergic to pollen and dust. The rooms are well kept.,
-1|The location is excellent - it's within walkable distance to many attractions and restaurants we wanted to visit, and most of the others were just a short ride away. Room size is comfortable for a hotel in a city, its bathroom is quite spacious. The only thing about this hotel is the reception staff. We were checked in by a stone-faced male staff at the front desk, and checked out by a female staff who was not friendly at all. If I hadn't met other people in the city, I would leave Seatlle with an impression that people there are rude and cold. Thankfully everyone else I met there were friendlier than Grand Hyatt's front desk staff.Seattle has a lot to offer I'm sure I will come back here - but probably not to this hotel.,
-1|We stayed at the Hyatt for a Christmas party. The room was everything you would expect from a Grand Hyatt. Updated, clean and comfortable. Check in was a nightmare. It took us at least 40 minutes. 3 people at the counter and only one of them was checking in anyone. We knew several of the people waiting in line. Two of them were sent to rooms that already had people in them. Then they had to come and wait in that 40 minute line again to get it straightened out. This sort of service is not what you would normally associate with a Grand Hyatt, especially with the rates they are charging. The Gold desk was not open and the concierge just sat there and did nothing to help either. The valet station was not operating smoothly either, both for check in and check out. All in all, the front of the house here needs some help.,
-1|You pay for the location but the hotel was fairly average as compared to Hyatt properties in other cities. The service was good but not particularly friendly. Staff were pretty aloof. The rooms were small but clean. Just didn't like the vibe. We will stay elsewhere on our next visit.
-1|hotel has good name but need up date for the guess room.bath tower need change to new one and Electric curtain is not working. shower head need change to new one. location is excellent and in the center of the city.
-1|The room was great. The only problem I had was that I called this hotel twice before I came to reserve a room under an employee discount once I got to the hotel the person I spoke to did not put my reservation in nor my name down so I had to pay 230 something bucks when I was suppose to pay 129 Im not sure if I would come back or not after talking to two people and neither did their job at all. Also the front desk agent ain't even try to ask me would i still like the employee discount added in which if I was a front desk agent I would still asked the guest if she still wanted to add the discount.
-1|Typical Hampton Inn - but that is good! Consistent service, amenities, quality rooms. Hotel was clean, efficient front desk, good breakfast available. convenient exit from highway. good rates available.,
-1|We were staying here because it was close to Cedar Point. I have stayed at Hamptons often in the past, as I am an owner with Hilton Grand Vacations Club. Typically Hamptons are great. This one definitely was not, some maintenance issues with the room, and did not seem as nice as other Hamptons I've stayed in. The WiFi is...
-1|Close to airport, clean, spartan, nice people, no negative experiences. 100 verse 175-200 options prior to Labor Day weekend. Was fine for what we needed. Coffee in the morning. Was only at hotel for 11 hours but would stay there again if needed.,
-1|We had high expectations due to all the great reviews, but we were slightly disappointed in our stay at Daisy Motel. The beds were VERY uncomfortable, so much so, that we didn't even stay the 3rd night we had planned to. We drove to Little Rock the 3rd night so that we could get some much needed sleep. The room...
-1|We've stayed in better motels for a cheaper price, but we have no major complaints and slept well. Sure, it's a bit outdated and worn, but everything worked, no bugs and for the price you really can't get too picky.,
-1|If you're you're looking for a nice place to sleep after a long drive or if you're a local looking for some peace quiet this is the perfect place. It's right off the exit, surrounded by additional hotels, restaurants and a Tarjay (Target). I was over near Lenox mall and I drove 20 minutes away to this hotel because...
-1|We come to New Orleans multiple times a year. We normally stay at another chain of hotels but our normal arrangements were booked full. This is our first time at this particular hotel and staying with this chain. The positives are this hotel is nice, very updated, we found our 2 bedroom suite to be very spacious, very clean, and the offerings for the food choices of the happy hour and breakfast exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff were very kind and helpful. They even assisted me to book needed activities for our family. The negatives are this establishment is ran so tightly it is at the expense of the comfort of its customers. The happy hour requires you to keep up with a card per adult to ensure you receive no more than 3 beverages. The happy hour offerings are of course well drinks and cheap wine. My husband accidentally spilled his last glass of wine at the bar and the employee made mention he was exceeding the allowable amount of beverage as he begrudgingly replaced it. The air conditioner is fixed to not go below 70 F. Our entire family was extremely uncomfortable and sweated all night. The tubs are fixed to only allow showers. There are not individual toiletries. Instead there is a shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser attached to the wall. It kind of grossed me out to think every other naked person before had touched it during their shower. They do advertise to earn so many reward points for everyday you do not utilize housekeeping so that leads me to believe this is a brand/chain initiative. It's a nice hotel that is uncomfortable and that's just unfortunate. My husband's review was, It's like being a guest of a cheapskate.
-1|I stayed at the Drury Inn for four nights in early January. This was the weekend of the national football championship final between Iowa and LSU, and the hotel seemed to be full of people that had come to New Orleans for the game.My room was spacious, clean, and nice and I had free wireless access to the internet. The service was good. I wasn't too happy with the breakfast, although there was a selection of different foods, coffee, pops, etc. available. Considering the price range, I was quite happy with the hotel and wouldn't mind staying there again.
-1|Not too bad for price. Liked the free drinks, popcorn, and breakfast. It fit our needs and was pretty convenient to a lot of points of interest. The front desk was very nice, let us check in early and was able to recommend a couple of restaurants for big families. Needed room key to access elevator, so we felt more secure. Rooms and bed were comfortable, no complaints.
-1|Staying here for couple weeks, it's a standard Hampton, clean, nothing exceptional. Some rooms have sofa area which is nice. Microwave and decent size mini fridge to grab a few things for the room. Pretty quiet, parking is good, easy access to local restaurants and shopping. Highway access is ok, odd on/off ramps here but haven't had an issue. This...

-1|You will not find a friendlier, accommodating staff than at The Partridge Inn. I thought I had left a small gray bag in the room, which my boyfriend had unknowingly packed with his belongings, and Herman was very helpful. I cannot say one negative word in regards to the staff. They were superb. I would recommend this hotel for its...
-1|Paper thin walls, can hear everything next door from them thinking to talking. Hallways hot(no air) and heat lamps in tiny elevator will have you sweat for sure. A/c units in rooms make too much noise,
-1|I come here every year, with my family. Used to be a great experience. Staff was always helpful. Not as good as it was for families, now you cant even have kids food in the lobby bar. Staff is not as welcoming as they used...
-1|My wife and I stayed here while visiting the Del Mar Fairgrounds. My wife liked it a lot, but I had some hesitations. The room did not have a mini-refrigerator which I thought all Hampton Inns had. If you are expecting a mini-frig, be sure and request it when making your reservations. The furniture and room colors were drab and boring, and could use upgrading or wall paper. The beds were very good. The flat screen t.v. was nice, but no HD channels, and in fact, only about a dozen channels. Could use Discovery and Fox Sports San Diego. The breakfast room downstairs is very big with a good breakfast, (although I would have liked some donuts or something sweet!). I thought the towels were very thin, and could use upgrading. There were no flyers/brochures of local attractions like all hotels have now days. I thought the Hampton Inn-Kearney Mesa was better. But, this hotel was VERY QUIET, considering all the people staying there during the fair! That was a major plus.
-1|Breakfast need to be improve service is not bad rooms kinda smells like wet rag overall is clean not enough tables n chairs in the lounge good air conditioning the price is not too bad for a peak summer
-1|Location was great next to the Interstate, and I had a wonderful view of the Taco Bell in the parking lot, but the bed was not great. Pillows were flat, bed was hard, and I woke up in pain every morning. On a positive note, breakfast was free and had a nice variety.
-1|An average Hampton Inn. However short on parking. (don't get there late at night) and poor wifi in rooms. (good in hallway and lobby) Great location for access to 5 fwy and Del Mar race track. Short drive to great beaches but definitely a drive, not a walk.,
-1|Motel is nothing special, just typical of what you would expect from a freeway close place to stay. Staff was very friendly and provided several items that we forgot, free of charge. No views but easy on easy off of I-5 and great location for all local attractions especially Del Mar racetrack.
-1|This Hampton is clean and fresh. Newer decor. Nice location near the 5 freeway but there is No noticeable freeway noise. Staff is freindly and efficient Highly recommend for a reliable no frills location in Del Mar.
-1|The bed was very comfortable. Also nice to have a fridge and microwave. Most features of the room are upgraded except heating at cooling couldn's adjust to a comfortable temperature. Free parking however the garage is very small and there were not enough spots on the lot and garage to accomodate all guest. Bathtub was stained which was not a good look but other than that, the room was clean. The staff could have been alot more friendly and helpful.,
-1|There was definitely an issue with the bathroom exhaust fan system as we had a bad stench of sewer gas in our bathroom for the three days we were there. We asked at the desk and all they did was spray which worked for about 20 minutes then the stench returned. Should have offered us another room.
-1|The room was very small, no room to relax at all. The beds were too small, the hotel only offered double beds A king or Queen bed was not even on the menu If you don't mind feeling like a sardine - check in !!
-1|We were here for an early dinner before starting a tour, and the restaurant was not busy. Very modern looking, and the food was good, but nothing exceptional. I don't think I'd make it a destination for eating, however.,
-1|Basic hotel that could use a good cleaning and updating, but cheaper rates then the chain hotels. Nicely located in Chinatown beside the adult entertainment clubs and crazy Chinese singing karaoke or something late at night. Plus side was free parking in a cramped lot.,
-1|We typically book Drury hotels while traveling and this is my second stay in this location for business. Ask for a room with a street view ..not interior...had to change rooms and while it was much smaller the street view was much better than looking into your neighbors room. Breakfast okay, social hour limits your free drinks to three. They...,
-1|Writing the review largely to give a shout out the the women at the front desk who tried to help us after discovering that the hotel was overbooked and that our hotel.com booking was essentially not valid, despite the fact that it had been booked, paid for and guaranteed, several months prior. The only notification we received was a call...
-1|We enjoyed our first stay her at this location and received an overall good impression. We didn't realize it was right next door to the Knights inn Carmel hills and were afraid it might be a bad experience like it was at that hotel. Luckily it was completely different in a good way! The hot tub is great and the...

-1|The Bowen Hotel is an older but updated hotel that is cheaper than most of the other hotels we checked in Moab. Parking is kinda tight there, but manageable. Room was fairly large, but we discovered that housekeeping had not put a top sheet on the bed. The lady at the front desk was apologetic and gave us a sheet...
-1|We had a one bedroom unit which was cozy, but we do like the two bedroom units better. It is a basic unit that needs quite a bit of upgrading including the beds. The location is great and the staff couldn't be nicer. The presentation about the area is outstanding, enjoyable, and well worth attending. There is a pool and...
-1|Came here with my 5-year-old son for a one night stay. On the bright side, check-in went smoothly and the room was clean. However, this is not a great location for families. It was too windy to use the outdoor pool, but we probably wouldn't have stayed in the pool long anyway because of the car exhaust coming from the...
-1|front-desk person was a nice young man, and the welcome bag was appreciated. was able to park right in front of my room and the highway noise wasn't too bad. needs a wastebasket in the bathroom, not just the main room. had fridge/microwave and small bathroom...perfect for a 1-night pass-through.
-1|Mixed review. Pros: large room, micro and fridge with large buffet counter sofa plus beds Nice view out rear window/patio. Cons: no decaf coffee in room brewer stained bedspreads (dry clean only) makes you wonder when they were cleaned last tons of rules neighboring guests took our chairs table from our patio and we would have asked for them... ,
-1|Really you have to discard your first impression. And, if we are honest, your second. I opened the door to my room and feared I had selected the wrong option in Friendsville -- but in my experience after a few days, I think I would stay again. My room was a king room on the second floor facing the pool....

-1|I booked through hotwire. The location was excellent, however the room I got was the smallest room available. It was no bigger than a cruise ship inside cabin. Housekeeping forgot to leave soap and towels one day. Overall its an ok hotel for the price.,
-1|Great location. From the staff. They need to remodel the elevator and some parts of the hotel. Siri did not work for two days in a row. I told the lady at the front desk and she offered no compensation
-1|The hotel is located very close to Michigan Ave. and has great access to the Mag mile and the loop. Service is excellent and friendly from the staff we came across. The hotel is very focused on self service from the check in, retrieving additional...,
-1|This was a pretty decent hotel for business travel. The room and bed was comfortable. The rooms are definitely small, but I didn't really spend much time in my room anyway. I didn't love that you have to go to a utility closet outside of your room to grab a ironing board and iron, but not a big deal -- kind of unique and boutiquey, I guess. This is definitely a unique hotel and modern hotel.The water pressure in the shower was really bad though, unfortunately. It took absolutely forever to rinse since there was nearly no water coming out -- not to mention the cold and uncomfortable feeling of being wet and cold without enough warm water rushing out. Why do so many hotels have water pressure issues This always drives me nuts -- it is so hit and miss too. One hotel will have great pressure in the city, and the next horrible.. I wish more reviewers spoke to water pressure haha. Or is that just me who cares about thatThe location is excellent -- right on the river and close by everything you need. The staff is also very friendly and helpful.I unfortunately got a room with no view so I cannot comment on the view, but I am sure the view would have been incredible from that location, if you had a river view. My window was quite small though, so not sure how they are on the other side of the building. Overall, if you're staying in Chicago, you will likely enjoy your stay at this hotel. It's basic and does the job. Very clean, modern and standard. One of the biggest things that determines my feelings on a hotel is the bathroom / shower experience.. its like make and break for me haha! So, unless they fix the water pressure issues, I likely won't be staying here again.
-1|We stayed at Club Quarters this weekend. It was the SMALLEST room we've ever stayed in. It was fine for one person and even though the room was well appointed, it really didn't fit our needs. Plus we were in the Tower. Very scary looking...,
-1|This is our 2nd hotel that we've stayed at on Route 66. The price was very reasonable but with that price comes some sacrifices. One of them being is no breakfast.

-1|Very nice, modern hotel. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The bar was very nice with excellent specially cocktails. Valet parking is very expensive!! It's much cheaper to park in a nearby deck and walk over to the hotel. Other than this, no complaints!

No highway or train noise - the hotel is up a quiet...

-1|Interestingly, the only vines you will see here are a few sad ones that grow around the edge of the parking lot. The location is ok for doing winery tours as you have access to the major Napa and Sonoma routes. The room was clean but the place was noisy. We had a room with a connecting door to another room and you could hear anything/everything through it from our bathroom. Lots of walking around noises from above as well. If I stayed there again I'd go for the top floor and make sure it wasn't a joined room.,
-1|The hotel room and bathroom were clean. No smoke odor or any other odor. Sheet and towers were clean. Everything work in my room (TV, lights, heater). My room was for one person really. They have bigger room too. For the price this is a nice hotel and close to must of the attractions (walking distant).TV work fine. It only have a table and a chair only, the bed and to night stand.Be careful if you park in the back of the hotel, take anything that will attract the attention. There are lot on homeless etc... but they won't bother you. I was walking late at night (2AM) with no problem. The room with the ice and soda machine was close. But they are around place to buy ice an anything else. Subway restaurant is across the street and lots if Vietnamese restaurants in the block. If you want a fancy hotel, this one if not for you. This is for people that will be out all day and return to take a shower and go sleep and watch tv while relaxing.
-1|a very average place to stay, but I am a very budget conscious traveler and and dont mind to save on a hotel to spend in other places, such as shopping at nearby downtown San Francisco!With in walking distance from Union Square and all the attractions restaurants and night lifethe city has to offer. NO WIFI in the rooms
-1|This hotel is decent, but not perfect if you are on the picky side. Pretty design sinks that are a hassle to use, not enough hanging spaces for towels, broken elevators, etc.... The staff is great, helpful and super friendly. Overall, a satisfying hotel.
-1|Decent hotel won on price line, rooms are extremely small. Staff was good. Location was OK at best.. Would rather pay more to be closer to the action and bigger rooms. Probably would pass on price line as well.,
-1|I stayed two nights at Hotel Felix - the room was a bit small but the bed was large and comfortable. The lighting in my room was at the end of the bed, so the far end of the room was a little dim, I had to turn the desk lamp on to see my suitcase. Also, some of the spotlights in the ceiling above the bed were not aligned with their hole (they had come loose and left a gap) which didn't help the lighting situation. The rest of the room was ok for a short stay but any longer and it could be a little uncomfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful and it's ideally located. You're only a few minutes walk from the L train stations. The bar and restaurant options in the hotel are quite limited - you have to go next door to the local bar for a drink and the lobby doubles as a sushi bar. I'd recommend if you're in town for a short stay or business but not for a longer visit.
-1|As Stash members we received a quiet room as requested on an upper floor away from the elevators. There was a musty odor to our tiny room that was otherwise clean and bright white when we entered. Toiletries are by L'Octane. Electrical outlets are adequate. Coffee and tea are served in the lobby in the morning. I was a little put off when a transient person walked in, used the lobby restroom, came out and made inquiries about jobs then proceeded to hang out talking loudly on a personal phone call. The staff seemed uncomfortable dealing with the situation.
-1|I stayed at the Hotel Felix for a week and had no complaints. Although not a chain hotel, they still offered complimentary tea and coffee in the mornings. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. It was an overall pleasant stay and there is no reason that I wouldn't return.,
-1|This place it out there in the woods. It is a bit hard to find. The location is very quite. It feels peaceful and secluded. However also maybe a bit creepy for the squeamish hearted. The place is pretty rustic with some hunting trophies on the wall and some dust and grime here and there. Not really sweet romantic getaway...
-1|I've stayed here at the Astoria Hotel every time I've visited The City except once and I've been visiting on a regular basis since 1986-1987. I stayed once at the Olympic Hotel on Mason Street near the Hilton and the Marriott off of O'Farrell St. The Olympic was on par with the Astoria but was bought out by the Art Institute for dorm space or whatever so it's been the Astoria ever since. I guess if I was a Hilton, Marriott or Hyatt kind of guy I wouldn't mind throwing away 200-250/night just for a place to sleep. Not to compare the two properties obviously but there are many more ways to spending your hard earned vacation money there in San Francisco as any other expensive locale. But maybe I have it all wrong which is a distinct possibility. What is it they say about real estate: location, location, location... At the corner of Grant and Bush next to the Chinatown gate, you couldn't ask for a more convenient location. And for you Starbucks junkies, there's one across the street. And it's cheap and that's one word you'll never hear associated with San Francisco. I guess when I can book r/t airfare and 7 nights at the luxurious Astoria for much less than 1|0, I shouldn't complain. I never pay full fare and if I think rates are high I just won't go, simple as that. But a few simple amenities wouldn't hurt. Like, for instance maybe a couple of microwaves in the community room on the second floor so the guests can warm up some leftover restaurant food or even warm up a cup of coffee for heaven's sake. Don't know how much it would cost to Wi-Fi each floor but the community room has it but I'm sure most guests would prefer the privacy of their own rooms. The breakfast items served on the second floor daily works for something on the run. And how about some vending machines and ice machines. We're not asking the owners to break the bank here but I've talked to a front desk person there who has mentioned these type of amenities to the owners for years and has had no response.But then again who do you think is going to absorb the costs of these added amenities and renovations. Their loyal customers like myself. Maybe if some of us took our business elsewhere they'd get the message. Probably not. Food for thought Astoria Hotel. Is anybody listening there.. I must give a shout out to the hard working housekeeping staff. They do a heck of a job and at least my room has always been clean, or let's say clean enough. And maybe add a few more channels and upgrade the TV's and make sure all the remotes work. Just saying...
-1|we stayed here for 6days,its in a good location,right at the gates of china town and trendy places to eat at,but it is old and the rooms need up dating
-1|The room was basic but clean, quite old fashioned and needs updating but the bed was comfortable enough and we got a quiet nights sleep where we were on the 7th floor. The room was cleaned each morning and fresh towels given. The free buffet breakfast was good, loads of different kinds of bagels, chocolate muffin/cakes, toast, eggs, cereal, tea and coffee. The bagels were the best i've tasted!! The breakfast room was very small and just a kitchen really but was nice and gave me that travelling vibe whilst i made and ate my toast alongside Germans, French and Dutch fellow travellers. One thing i did not like about the hotel was the lift!!! By the second day i was taking the stairs! All 7 flights of them...! The lift is tiny, very scary and just felt like it was about to go at any second! The hotel is situated right next to the Chinatown gateway which is a great location. 5-10 minute walk to Union Square and the main shopping area. One day we walked to the Coit Tower from the hotel and then kept on walking down to Fishermans Warf, if you look at the map you will see we covered some distance but in my opinion - its the best way to explore around. We even walked all the way back!!I was pleased with our stay, for the low price we paid we got a comfortable bed to sleep in, clean bathroom, free breakfast and it was in walking distance for pretty much everything we needed.
-1|I stayed for over a week. You get what you pay for, but it was fine where I stayed (5th Floor). For 56/night (taxes incl), close to everything, and away from the seedier parts of downtown, it's a pretty good deal.They don't change the sheets every day, but do you change your bed sheets every day at home I believe they change every 3 or 4 days, but you have to ask them.I didn't see any bed bugs. But I took precautions, just in case. I kept things off the floor, and I put a big clear plastic garbage bag around my suitcase. And I brought double-sided tape to use as bug trap if I needed it (which I didn't).The breakfast, if you chose to buy the breakfast tickets for 4, consisted of toast, bagels, milk, juice, boiled eggs, and a chocolate snack (all bought from Costco).There is WiFi, but you have to go into this big room on the second floor to get it - no big deal.If you need some deals or ideas of what to do, in the lobby, you will see a rack full of brochures. Some of those brochures have coupons in it for restaurants or ideas on what to do in SF.Yes, you don't get the quality of service in a 4 or 5 star hotel, but you get what you pay for. It's either a one-star (if you take the shared bathroom) versus the two-star (private bathroom) facility.I would recommend this place to people who aren't fussy and who don't have high expectations.,
-1|Pros- Very good location- Newly renovated- Clean rooms and fully equiped baths- Comfortable for business trips- Good internet connectionCons- The smell, I noticed it in many hotels similar to this one (but you get used to it)- If you get a room with the view to the street, it is very noisy (the windows are very old)- You cannot pay online, and if your company pays for you, make sure all the papers are signed in advance- The furniture and the beds are old,
-1|Easy to walk to various points of interest and neighbourhood felt safe and friendly. Lots of restaurants nearby. Free parking and relatively cheap rates. A good base for a few days in San Fran.
-1|Stayed here for 6 days. Location is very good, right in the marina and cow hollow area which has many good restaurants and bars. MUNI stops right around the corner. The hotel and room are pretty run down. Old and and show signs of wear and tear. Tv made a weird noise. No AC, just heater(which also makes noise). Beds are ok. Bathroom is nice. The cleaning staff does daily cleaning of the room. For the kind of price paid, I didn't have high expectations, plus it was just a place to crash at night so overall it worked out. Area can sometimes be noisy due to the fire station being around the corner and bar/restaurant patrons walking the surrounding streets. If you are a light sleeper maybe some earbuds would be good. Overall: it's a budget hotel that shows its age and wear and tear. The location is very good and feels safe. If you are looking for a place to just sleep in, are not too picky about a room and don't have much money to spend in a nicer hotel then this would work for you.
-1|Stayed there on 18/19 September 2004. Rooms are simple but clean. Area has good selection of restaurants and bars and an especially good cafe for breakfast, Home Plate on Lombard opposite the Ihop. It is noisey due to traffic and poor insulation, but was good location for travelling around. Fishermans Wharf is about 15 minutes walk and the no. 30 MUNI can be caught on Chestnut.
-1|Like staying at your grans house but your gran stays on the main bus line to town.That is all you need to know, oh and you don't really like your gran that much.BUT i have to write 200 characters which is a bit silly to be honest so ill just comment on how 200 characters is a bit silly until it accepts that some places only need reviewed with a sentence or two.,
-1|I am from Miami and used to go to the Sand Bar lounge (which is no longer there) when a lot younger. This accommodation is what you would expect from a motel of the 50's. Clean enough, terrazzo floors, and furnishings were just barley suitable. Over all (considering rate) we enjoyed. Beach front and nice pool.
-1|We were in San Francisco for 6 days, and we stayed at the Monarch.They were nice enough to check us in early,but the room had a slight smell and a view of the apartment that was 10 feet away. The bed was clean,but the pillows really really flat,and I am not a pillow person.It was cold in the room so bring warm socks(this was in Aug), warm pajamas and a pillow.The washrooms were clean and the bathtub deep.The safe did not work and if the temp.outside was hot,we would be in trouble,because it the AC was missing knobs.The tv had 15 channels and HBO( a few great movies).The Wi-Fi worked and the morning coffee was good. The biggest problem was that the area was loud at night with the homeless and druggies talking/yelling until 1am.In the morning the homeless were very visable and at night,I would not want to be coming in late if you are on your own. SO the hotel it self is worth the savings,but the area I something to really really consider and I am a city girl.Stay in little Italy or near the Warf,these are the cleaner and safer areas. Enjoy your time in San Francisco!
-1|I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews but I found the Monarch to be very comfortable. The rooms were clean and the linens were fresh. Our room was always cleaned by the maid service prior to 11am. The staff also was very helpful in getting cabs, shuttles, and directions. Also I wanted to let people know that this is a big city neighborhood. There are homeless people in the neighborhood asking for change, but you find the same people at the wharf and union square. So if you have a budget or even if you dont I recommend the Monarch. You can walk to Union Square in 10 minutes, spend 7 bucks on a cab to the wharf, or walk around the corner to Van Ness and shop for a new Land Rover or Mercedes.
-1|This is a well managed, clean hotel with nice enough rooms and a great cleaning staff. Just don't expect to do a lot of walking from your hotel after dark or to be able to leave your windows open at night. We heard people yellow/fighting in the street all night and a lot of dog fighting. I walked to and from the hotel during the day with no problem but at night this is a pretty sketchy location.Bottom line- if you are looking for somewhere clean and affordable, this place is fine, just don't plan to spend time in the few blocks around the hotel.
-1|The hotel is very well located close to Van Ness avenue and close to the main points and attractions in SF.
-1|Nice hotel close to downtown and Civic Center and one block from Van Ness. Hotel reminds me of small european hotel with beautiful lobby and elevator. Staff was helpful. Secure building, all rooms are inside secure lobby. Rooms are clean and roomy with windows that open. Coffee and tea in lobby. It is downtown SF so there will be some street noise. Paid parking next to hotel. Good place for the price. Felt secure staying alone.,
-1|First the bad - you get what you pay for, the building old and the lifts are rickety - one of those lifts where your not sure if you will make it up to your floor or not! The safe isn't electronic so you need to go to the reception pay 5 and get a key. Slightly worryingly the receptionist told me they only have a certain number of keys for the safes. As mentioned the streets close by are full of homeless, drunks and junkies. That said, there isn't too much the hotel can do about that.The rooms are not too bad, enough space and have a walk-in wardrobe to hang your clobber. Despite my earlier comments the hotel is central enough to get around the main attractions in a short taxi journey. A good place to stay if you aren't planning on spending much time in the hotel.,
-1|The hotel decor is a bit dated and the rooms slightly neglected. The bathroom wasn't great we did complain about our shower and the did quickly send a housekeeper to take a look at it. The rooms were a moderate size. There is a bit of noise from the streets below however it is a city destination. What I wish we knew beforehand is that it is opposite a night shelter for the homeless therefore there were. Few people on the street corner talking/signing and praying to themselves. Was slightly intimidating walking pass in the evenings. The valet took 20 /30 mins to collect the car when requested during the stay- though the staff were helpful. Rooms don't have a coffee machine either. The lighting in the rooms was dim - little impractical and the plug sockets a bit suspect.
-1|Hotel Monarch is old hotel, but furniture was the room is not bad and there was enough for us. There were even hairdrier, iron, iron table in the room. Room was clean enough. At the begining, when we were going to our room, we felt the smell in the corridor (old carpet, corpses) In the room though it was ok. Location is not bad. It's not the center, but we got to most places on foot, that took from 15 to 40 minutes (Chinatown, Academy of Science, Piers). Hotel proposes guests free tee-coffee and WI-FI. Tee and coffee was ok, but WI-FI didn't work in reallity. Our laptop found good connection, but if we opened web-pages, they can't be downloaded. Once we witnessed, how six different people came to reception with the same problem. The staf tried to help, but in vain. But if Internet connection is not important in your trip, it's not bad place to stay.
-1|Hotel staff was awesome during my entire 4 day stay! The hotel however, needs serious updating and plumbing maintenance. Decor is okay, rooms are small, floors/walls are quite thin. I could here the activities and conversations of those in nearby rooms. Insufficient ventilation in bathroom causing serious fog for hours. Area is heavily populated with homeless people with a community centers across the street from hotel. Wifi was horrible. No microwave. Refrig in select rooms. Elevator issues due to being so outdated. No breakfast, but coffee available 24/7 in lobby along with knats. Again front desk guys and housekeeping were very nice. Easy walk to union square, clubs, bars and food. Management really needs to invest in updates to the property's plumbing, wifi, guest accommodations to include refrig/microwaves and the environment immediately around the hotel as much as possible. Some guest room views are an open space shared with the apt complex next door and displays trash and a view into tenants' apts. I paid too much for my experience.
-1|Got a nice road facing room, with nice bed. Lot of choices of restaurants available. Quick check in and friendly staff. Nice recommendation for food. Free wi-fiBut poor walls. You can even hear others radio or water running in adjacent room. That's a problem!,
-1|Not too many choice in this area but this hotel seems like the best choice. We rented one of the cabins. The locations is excellent, they have tall trees everywhere plus chairs and fire pits outside each cabin. Our cabin (and our friends cabin) was a bit worn out. The biggest disappointment was the fireplaces in each cabin did not...,
-1|Stayed here for a couple of nights it was ok. Its right next to a Shell gas station and the freeway which was a huge plus. Denny's is on the property so breakfast was easy. They do allow pets the guy next door had a dog barking all night so my wife didn't get much sleep. The check-in office smelled like cigarette smoke both days. I had to use the washer and dryers which charge about 6 dollars (all quarters) a load which is crazy and they supplied me with change which was cool. The bed sheets were very thin. They had nice sinks, tv was ok but cable channels were average. Parking was tight. Overall it was ok some good things some bad.,
-1|Overall, I enjoyed my two night stay at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in Downtown Chicago, but have a few concerns. I was in town with a bus load of University of Louisville fans to support our basketball team during the game with DePaul University. There were not enough suites available with two double beds at the hotel to accommodate our group. So, I had to share a king-sized bed with my roommate. We were really disappointed that we couldn't have our own bed. So, we each rotated sleepng in the bed one night and then sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room. However, the sofa bed was absoultely horrible!!! The mattress was very thin and the inner springs poked through the surface of the mattress. This made sleeping very uncomfortable. Also, the top portion of the mattress where your head goes was higher than the rest of the mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a slant. The mattress was so uncomfortable until I closed the sofa bed and replaced the cushions. Then I tried putting the cover on top and sleepng on top of the sofa, However, I am 5'11 tall and the sofa was more like a loveseat size. So, I could not stretch out completely. I got very little sleep and awoke stiff and sore. My back and neck hurt. It was also awkward having to go through the bedroom to use the toilet and shower in the bathroom or to get clothes from the closet without disturbing my roommate while she slept in the bed. The layout of the suite was not well-thoughout as far as utilization of the bathroom and closet.On the plus side of the suite, the kitchen was wonderful! We liked having a fully equipped kitchen with appliances and dishes. We also enjoyed the breakfast!
-1|If you're looking for a hotel that won't break the bank on your vacation than this is it. We got two rooms for four nights and it was just about 500. It is a very basic hotel with only a few amenities (fitness center, and...,
-1|I needed to find a very budget friendly place in Orlando for a long weekend. I was very afraid with what I was going to get, but for the price, I was happy with it. It was spacious and clean, and the location to Universal...
-1|If you are looking for the bare minimum this is the place to go. Be prepared to pay for the internet even when they say its free 3.50 day. They dont have cable either, they have 26 preprogramed channels. They had a great pool and...,
-1|Very old motel. The parking lot needed to be repaved. Rooms were small but they were comfortable. They could have used some updating. There was wifi. A Dollar General was next door. There are a couple of fast food places North on US 75.
-1|We were in the area for a family reunion. The only reviews we saw on this hotel were discouraging, but since it came on a local recommendation and all three bad reviews looked like they came from the same guests, we stayed there for two nights anyway and had no problems. I travel a lot, but have gotten out of...
-1|I am not a fan of Best Western,HOWEVER, this one is not bad. The continental breakfast is poor and the coffee out of the machine is strong. Now the coffee served in the room for my group I was with was good. The rooms are decent. Bathroom was a nice size with spacious room on the vanity. Towels were also...
-1|Visibly a very nice place, great pool when not crowded, good cheeseburgers. As a smoker you have to hit the parking lot, and watch the rats at night running to the garbage area. (Don't think the place is infested, just the local wood rats looking...,
-1|We had 4 adults and 1 child (age 7). This was our grandchild's first trip away from home. Room 120 is marketed as a suite. It's not. It's a regular hotel room with 2 queen size beds and then a closet with a full size bed inside of it. I kid you not!The grandparents (us) wanted a seperate bedroom so we were stuck in the closet. There was not enough room for 2 adults to walk around in the room. You open the door and there's the bed. There was 6 from the edge of the opened door to the edge of the bed. The bed was up against the wall. There was one tv in the entire suite. That tv was outside of the closet bedroom. There was one side table lamp in the suite and that was not in the closet bedroom. The closet bedroom had a floor lamp on the opposite side of the closet from the bed and a blaring overhead light. There was just enough room in the closet bedroom to open one piece of luggage. There was a very small side table in the closet bedroom where one could put their clothes in...a bit tough if there's 2 adults in the closet bedroom staying 4 nights. What little carpet you were exposed to in the closet bedroom was sticky as though someone had spilled a soft drink by the side table.Had we known this we never would've booked here. Thus the reason for me writing to help other guests.The staff was extremely nice. We had rented a scooter and that was left in the hotel lobby overnight as none of the hotel rooms on the property would be able to accomodate a scooter. We were provided with plenty of clean towels in the one small bathroom in our suite.The pool was very clean.The breakfast consisted of frozen donuts (no microwave is available in the lobby eating area...if you wanted them heated up you had to take it to your room and use your microwave there), powdered scrambled eggs, bagels, small yogurts, a few pieces of fruit, milk, juice and coffee. Cereals were available from the bulk cereal dispenser and there was a waffle maker. The breakfast area was tiny. Since we stayed here from Oct 23 - Oct 27 there weren't a bunch of families to battle with in this breakfast area. I can not even fathom eating in the breakfast area during summer vacation, spring break, or during the holiday season when multiple families are in abundance. The seating consisted of 4 tables...2 tables accomodated 4 people and 2 tables accomodated 2 people (12 people total in the seating area). Of note, since this was something we had never experienced in any other hotels we've stayed in over a 40+ year span, there were two police vehicles parked outside the lobby with officers in the lobby that started one of our mornings off before heading to the Happiest Place on Earth. We didn't want to know what may have happened for their being there but the officers weren't there to partake in the breakfast, if you catch my drift.Parking was adequate and free. The maids like to trash talk about the guests in Spanish. This might be ok for persons who aren't Spanish-fluent, but we are. There's a sand pit playground area in the courtyard. It seemed to be in good repair. Our grandson didn't play in the area. I can't speak for any noise level this may cause in the rooms that surround the courtyard.Don't say you weren't warned. You get what you pay for. And no, we would never stay here again.
-1|This hotel was a very good rate. We stayed here mid-september on a stop over trip to San Fran. The hotelroom had plenty of space for our family of 3 BUT it did smell really really musty. The shower curtain was a bit worn. The water pressure was great! The breakfast provided was very good but the seating area was so incredibly small. The woman at the front desk was a wonderful help with out Disneyland visit. She gave us some tips and helped us order our tickets.
-1|Very affordable given the Area. Close to Disneyland and also the Anaheim Packing District. We stayed here on the 2nd floor. Place was nice and clean, but we found it a little more difficult having to get to the floor by means of elevator as the stairs were a bit farther off. Service was ok and room had all the essentials, but there was one small snafu. Gf noticed a big spider on the ceiling which frightened her and when I mentioned to the front desk morning person, he just shrugged it off. Otherwise, a decent stay.,
-1|Stayed here in July booked with Travelocity. A large part of my disappoint I will blame on Travelocity, I'm pretty sure I was booking a Best Western that was 'right across' from Disneyland and with the inflated price, I was sure of it. When I arrived I of course expressed my concern to the Front Desk and they happily called the other Best Western to see if there was avail, but there was not. They very kind and down to earth front desk clerk checked us in early (9:30AM on a Monday) and we got a 1st floor room very close to the lobby, which I would actually recommend. The room: beds were pretty comfy, bed linens were soft, pillows were plentiful, towels could have been better but did the job. There was a fridge and coffee pot in the room along with a hair dryer. AC unit was a bit loud but when we came back to the room for naps, it didn't bother us one bit. I can't complain much about the room itself --nothing went wrong or was out of place. The location: Here is where I'll get picky. I would not recommend walking to the park with little ones from here. You have to cross a majorly busy intersection, then walk through the Cast Member parking lot (finally found a safe walking area inside). This will bring you to the end of Downtown Disney, from here you can either take the Monorail to Tomorrowland or walk what would be another 'block' to the Main Entrance. I would not do this at night time! Good thing is there is an ART shuttle right in front of the property. I swear by these ART shuttles, 5/day for a shuttle to the front of the parks and runs every 20 mins. Again a positive thing about our room location is that we were able to just open our room door and keep an eye out for the shuttle and then run to it. Long story short, I overpaid on Travelocity, even after considering the location mix up. But the staff is remarkable so it made up for it.
-1|If you're vacationing at Disney Land this is one of (out of maybe 25) the best properties you can stay in. if your staying in Anaheim for any other reason, I strongly urge you to find a location further away from Disney Land. The room...,
-1|We had a decent stay here. I booked this hotel for the price and proximity to Disneyland. We were able to either drive, walk or take a shuttle to Disneyland with ease and the price was only about 100-110 a night. For the price, it was a good value. But an older hotel. While the rooms have been refurbished and are clean with nice linens, the A/C was an old swamp cooler in the wall and was very loud. And the only way to keep the room cool in 100 degree heat all weekend, was to run it 24 hours a day. Not great for sleeping. Also, there were small bugs that kept showing up in the bathroom, probably one or two a day. Not sure what they were, just kinda gross. The staff was friendly and efficient. The pool/spa area was very nice. The stay overall was good.,
-1|This is an older hotel but my room was comfortable and clean however the furnishings are old. The best rooms face outside as the pool are can get very noisy ! The breakfast area is very small with a bad selection of items, however there is a diner next door if you want a cooked breakfast !,
-1|The check in area was really nice. The room was ok. Water stain in ceiling. Big refrigerator, microwave, small coffee maker. Had to use ironing board couldn't get it to close. Banquet rooms where nice. There where at least 3 that I know of.
-1|This property was ok for one night, but was just average. The rooms themselves were not comfortable. It was not that they were dirty, but just did not appeal to myself or my family. I cannot put my finger on it, but we were not relaxed. I have stayed at the Fairfield Inn across the street before and it is...
-1|A serviceable place to stay in Waikiki, not a destination This budget hotel was perfectly adequate for a two-night stopover in Waikiki. No doubt the building is old and has been refurbished a number of times. But our room and the public spaces were clean...,
-1|My stay was a quite pleasant one. The room was clean, neat and fresh. I was very satisfied about the room. My stay was too quick to judge the other facilities. However, when we first arrived, the staff at the receptionist don't even say good...
-1|If I wanted to come and go, they made it difficult to park without paying immediately. sometimes I wasn't sure whether I wanted all day or only a couple hours. sometimes I ended up paying both due to pressure from the desk and parking police....,
-1|For most purposes, the hotel was just fine and reasonably priced by Waikiki standards. Everything was clean, the a/c worked fine, and the bed was nice. Of course you don't have beachfront access, but at this price I can accept that. If they attended to...,
-1|I was well aware of the construction/remodeling going on at this hotel, so that was expected. The room was as expected, nothing special. The pool was nice and I very much liked the access I had to extra towels there. Just a tip about parking...
-1|We stayed at this hotel for 1 night prior to a cruise. The hotel was adequate for our needs for one night. The room was badly in need of a refurbishment. When we returned from our cruise we stayed at a different hotel
-1|Although looking dated, the hotel was clean and in a good location for Waikiki. Easy access onto Waikiki Beach via the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort. Bus to Pearl Harbour stops right outside the hotel. Hotel staff were helpful when needed.,
-1|One night stay on 09/30/2016. It was just your run of the mill, standard hotel in a desirable location. Room was clean, but dated. Staff was reasonably friendly, but seemed overly concerned with how many occupants would stay in each room, requiring me to give...,
-1|Had a great holiday at the Ramada plaza. The rooms were a bit small but it was close to lots of shopping and some great restaurants. Outbacks was devine cuisine and the staff were faboulous. So is Red Lobster... mmmmmm yummy. There is very little...
-1|We stayed at this hotel after a rock concert. I have to admit, I was not feeling very safe walking back to the hotel. The shuttle said they would pick us up, but after waiting 30 minutes, we decided to walk back. I was nervous.... The room was large and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay here again, but I wouldn't be out walking around there after dark.,
-1|I was having a knee replacement across the street at Rush Ortho so I stayed here for 2 nights. Great location...and the service is very good. Marriott just needs to spend some money updating. The breakfast buffet is very good...20.00. There are many good restaurants around this property.
-1|Stayed for three nights with the UIC rate (169/night).The good:+ Comfortable, clean, spacious room+ Conveniently located to UIC and 5 minutes from Taylor street (lots of restaurant options)+ Friendly staff+ Reasonable fitness room - 6 pieces of cardio equipment and free weights with one bench+ Reasonably priced restaurant with good selection of options (for a hotel)The bad:+ Internet was wireless only and was not free - Marriott needs to differentiate itself by making this free across all of its brands. Internet access is now no longer the novelty it was two decades ago!+ No ability to turn up the heat - choice was either Air Conditioning (very cold) or no fan. I went with the latter...
-1|Did my reservation through Orbitz so it was about 30 a night. Met three different staff members, and they were all very nice. The room was clean, spacey and fully stocked with towels and toiletries. If you are doing sightseeing in Macon, the hotel is only about 10 min away from downtown.
-1|Pelican Post had no one on duty when we arrived a tad after 6 p.m. on the date we'd reserved. There was a note allowing us to access our room. The room included a small room for watching T.V./cooking and, beyond, a nice large bed. The colors were warm and pleasant, the kitchen, clean and stocked w/ dishware. This was...,
-1|Stayed here for biketoberfest 2015 and this was a perfect location for that. Close to Main Street and more importantly, right on the beach. This is a small family run motel and like most places in Daytona, the facilities are dated. The owners are very friendly and caring. The beds are good, the bathroom shower clean and the a/c cold....
-1|Stayed here recently to celebrate my anniversary. The location is good, all the restaurants and bars are within walking distance. The hotel itself was nice but me and my boyfriend felt a little out of place. We are 25 and were definitely some of the youngest people there. I chose this hotel because there was a balcony option and the view was nice. Valet could use some work, seems like they are understaffed in that department and its also pretty expensive (42 a day). All in all I enjoyed my stay but will consider other places next time Im in SD. Maybe something more age appropriate and lively.
-1|Location is great, right on the edge of Chinatown with Union Square and Columbus Avenue both within easy walking distance. We didn't try the food always went out - plenty of restaurants (breakfast cafes) within easy walking distance. Rooms are small but well equipped - the bathroom was as big as the bedroom.,
-1|Stayed here for business so unsure what the normal rate is but this was pretty cheap compared to others so it was a good value. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Bathroom is average with average shower. I liked the slippers and robe. Lobby is small and service was fine. My main complaint is the fitness center is very small with only three cardio machines and know weights. They offer passes at another gym for 15. Good location near china town and financial district. Overall pretty decent hotel.
-1|I stayed at the Orchard Garden last month, as business took me to San Francisco and there were literally no other hotel rooms available downtown between 75 and 450 per night some huge conference was going on and there was NO hotel availability. So I chose this hotel out of necessity (as I really had no choice), but was pleasantly surprised during my stay. The hotel is green, which I appreciate. Biodegradable bath product packaging (although the products themselves are still full of chemicals, boo), room key controlled lighting (very European), etc. The bathroom floor was heated (huge bonus in the morning) and the room was spacious enough. My view was of another close building, so that left a bit to be desired, and my room smelled of old lady perfume a little. I wasn't able to check out the rooftop garden but heard from a colleague that it's a great spot when the weather is nice. This hotel probably isn't my first choice for future trips to SF, as it was farther from my office than I'd like and I have other favorite hotels in the city, but it's definitely doable and I would stay here again if need be.
-1|Be aware - the hotel has no air conditioning -- something they bury deep in their website and something you'd probably never think to ask. It was in the mid-70's when I was there and the temperature in my room was fine. They do have very large and very effective ceiling fans and the windows do open about a foot to let the air in. But... c'mon -- no A/C in a downtown hotel Otherwise, the hotel is just OK - it's clean and the rooms are a decent size, but it obviously hasn't been renovated in 20-30 years and it shows around the edges. There is free wifi, though, so you'll save 15 over a name brand hotel there...,
-1|I've had to go to San Francisco a lot for business recently and I've been trying many hotels around Union Square.Kensington Park Hotel was the best value for the time I was staying this time.Upon arrival, I realised that this was an old hotel. It wasn't poorly but it was just dated. The lady behind the counter was nice and I checked in relatively quickly.I was on the 6th floor and the room was surprisingly nice. The bed was big and comfortable and a big TV with three big windows. The bathroom was your typical white tile bathroom but it was tasteful also. Even though I was right by the elevators, it was very quiet.I didn't try the food or the theatre so I cannot comment.One problem was that you really had to slam the door shut. The latch was quite stiff so trying to let it shut on its own was not going to happen. For the first night, I returned to find my door ajar as I didn't close it hard enough.For another couple of days, the elevator was out of action so I walked up to my room. An unusual eclectic mix of carpets!Overall, it was comfortable. Given the location, it's good value and well maintained if nothing to shout about.
-1|Nice old hotel in a busy location with lots of stuff to do in the area. Parking cost 15 a night which was ok and worth it. Small rooms. Hardly any guests in December when we were there. There is a no alcohol policy at the pool/hot tub which left us not using it. The 250 total cost per night seemed excessive but for the area is probably the norm. View of the ocean was great once you get over the homeless people openly using drugs on the boardwalk. All in all it was an ok place.
-1|I do a good share of traveling and stayed here as a last minute situation. With the 405 night gouge, they really like taking advantage of weary travelers. The don't accept AAA or any other type of discount. The best part of the room was the view of the boardwalk, but everything else was very average or below average for hotel accommodations.Thank you for your feedback. Our prices are not meant to take advantage of weary travelers by any means. In fact, our rates are priced very strategically so we are neither the most expensive, nor the most affordable, property here in Pacific Beach. We set our rates so that we can confidently say that we offer the most value in town - no other property offers as many complimentary amenities and/or as affordable amenities as we do.That being said, room prices on the beach are generally higher than elsewhere because our location is simply unbeatable. Not only is our location unbeatable in San Diego, but there are very few properties situated like ours in all of Southern California.Lastly, prices during peak seasons, like spring break, will always be higher with the higher demand.
-1|The staff is great - very friendly and helpful. I paid 370 per night for my room (reservations directly with the hotel), so based on the price and other reviews, I expected a pretty nice room. I thought it was pretty dumpy. There was obvious prior water damage on the walls and ceiling, which was poorly repaired. The carpet was old and felt dirty. I made sure to wear flip flops or socks in the room. The bed was extremely hard, so I did not sleep well and woke with a sore back. The whole room, including the bathroom, was painted a dark blue-green. I did enjoy the balcony. Not sure whether to give the hotel a 2 or 3.I did not partake in much of the breakfast which consisted of a waffle station, hard boiled eggs, pastries and cereal. They did have amazing apples, oranges, peaches and plums.The location of the hotel is excellent. I really enjoy P.B. Just wish my hotel room had been better.
-1|1. Front desk crew courteous but very young.2. Continental breakfast is OK. At times you had difficulty getting a table mid morning. 3. Exterior of hotel needs painting and maintenance. 4. Air conditioner in room is weak. 5. This is not a Marriott or Starwoods hotel. 6. Location to beach is very nice. 7. Parking in garage is very tight. I damaged my right side driver mirror trying to park our Yukon XL last night. The parking garage is setup for compact cars. Not everyone drives a compact car. 8. Hotel maintenance staff is very courteouse and responsive. It is my guess that hotel ownership is tight with capital dollars for improvements if they can fill the hotel without too much trouble at the rates they charge. 9. The empty building across from the hotel should be torn down. It detracts from the area. 10. The fire department is one (1) building over. This is good if you have a fire and from a security perspective but bad if they are out on calls and sound the sirens. 11. Only saw a few street people. The SD PD made two (2) arrests of street people when we were there. They were very proactive in this area. 12. The location of the SD Life Guard station is very positive. The beach are by the hotel is monitored heavily. The life guard staff on the beach were very proactive on currents in the ocean. 13. The beach needs to cleaned daily from the seaweed. 14. We walked 3 miles up and down the beach and most of the folks seemed to be tourists that were on the beach. 15. You have many restaurant options within walking distance. 16. Hotel has onsite security in the evenings and after hours.
-1|OPI's actually encouraging people via email to write TripAdvisor evaluations even though they're undergoing renovation of their bathrooms. I'm a little surprised since I can't really rate this stay as high as I have in the past, due to ongoing construction. Anyway, I stayed here 4 nights at their 99 construction rate. Can't beat the rate, though you will have to tolerate workmen pounding away on things all day long, including Saturday and Sunday. However, they didn't start too early in the morning. And there's a fair amount of dust and sharing of the (slow) elevator with construction dudes rolling away carts of material to dump. I had a side room for the first time - not as nice as the ones that look out over the pool to the beach, but it put me farther away from the construction noise so I didn't really mind on this trip. As always, P.B. can be a wild place on the weekends -- good or bad, depending on what you're looking for -- but be prepared.
-1|The location is superb. I had a 3rd floor ocean view room which had a terrific view. My disappointment was in the 3 hairs I found, one obvious by the sink and two when i pulled back the sheets. Also, the furnishings are a bit outdated and shoddy. The staff was friendly.
-1|Stayed here because I attended a seminar at the Catamaran hotel, a 10-15 min walk on the boardwalk. Hotel is right on the beach walking distance to many restaurants. Hotel and room is your typical older hotel in a beach town. Nothing special, but you are paying for proximity to the beach. The boardwalk is safe even in the early morning. Highly recommend CBW restaurant which is a healthy fast food place for salads bowls and wraps. Within a block of the hotel. Note: parking is extra. They have their own underground parking.
-1|Not as close to UCF as I had hoped. The room was fairly large and had 2 queens which I like. Beds were comfy with good pillows. Bathroom was clean. My only complaint would be the carpet - didn't seem very clean and I kept my shoes on. Bathroom floor was clean though. I don't think it's worth 109/night. Annoying guests who stood outside my room and smoked and talked all night. I didn't have the breakfast so I can't comment on that.I am trying to book a place for an upcoming weekend in the UCF area and I guess I'm gonna go with this place again, although I'd rather find someplace else. It seems that near UCF there are only very expensive choices or total dives. This one is in between so I guess I'll book it. Everything else is filling up fast.,
-1|Our stay was okay, Staff was good, Breakfast was good, Pool was very nice, Rooms were pretty good for the price. Grounds were kept up nice and clean, Great weather. Checkout was very fast. When we had problems they were helpful.Dear Frederick WThank you for the review of my Best Western East Orlando Florida.It is always great to hear how convenient our location is for the many guests who need to be near all the activities whether they be work or pleasure.I am extremely fortunate to have a fantastic team to work with. They are truly what makes this hotel great. I will be sure to recognize them publicly at our next celebration.
-1|Just stayed one night not a bad room just to get some sleep, Front desk very professorial and Quick check in and out processes. Overall a good experience. Not the flashest room or hotel but for a night its worth that.,
-1|The staff was really friendly especially during check in and at breakfast. Breakfast was delicious and offered a good variety. My room appeared clean and upgraded. It was also spacious. Location was really convenient.
-1|My husband and I called the Best Western 800 number to inquire about this Property. We especially wanted a hotel with restaurant, bar, pool and central conveniences and shopping. Expecting we wouldn't have to leave here for anything as we have been driving for hours. we were informed that all of the above are at this BW site After arrival... finding that there was a pool but NONE of the other amenities. this hotel is in the middle of nowhere. We also booked weeks ahead for early checkin. still didn't get checked in until almost 4pm. Other folks arrived after us and were checked in before us. Another couple we spoke with at the pool were mislead as well. The floor/carpet by the bed was soaking wet and smelled of musty/moldy..so we called for several towels to absorb the water. The manager gave us a bag of candy, pretzels and two pops for our trouble. I don't want to put down the hotel because it is quite nice ..we were upset about the MISLEADING information. because NOW we have 3 more days booked here in March that we cant get out of because we booked it through airmiles.
-1|My husband and I enjoyed staying at your hotel except for one thing: bed sheets and linen. I noticed that the linen were not replaced with new sheets. At first I tried to ignore it but then when I was getting ready to sleep that was when I felt something itchy on my left leg and when I checked it, I noticed some red small dots on my skin. It started to itch the moment I sat on the bed. And also, I watched your housekeeping staff how she cleaned the room: she did not vacuum the floor, did not change the bed sheets and not really properly cleaned the whole room.
-1|I have stayed here 4x over the 1 1/2 years. I stay here for the convenient location to my destination. Not sure if it is under new management or not, but I have certainly noticed some improvements to the rooms and the friendliness of the staff. The breakfast is always good and the pool is kept clean. Now, if they can just add some weather strip around the doors to the rooms...too much heat and light come in.
-1|I checked in late by reception was quick and efficient. I requested a room I could park in front of, and got one.The room was fine. An old style A/C unit on the outside wall worked great and wasn't too loud.TV was 32 Flat Screen with a good selection of free channels.Downside...Bathroom was extremely small. A tiny sink and counter in the bedroom, and the tiniest bath/shower/toilet I can ever remember experiencing. No non-slip mat or strips were provided. It was very clean, however.Breakfast was a tad under standard for a BW...No hot items, unless you consider Eggo style waffles...,
-1|Room was not cleaned one of the days I stayed there. Breakfast was average. Ice machine not great. Parking was good. Internet was fast, but had to log password every 24hrs. Overall is was an average stay.,
-1|Hotel could use some renovation, but it was convenient for my purpose. The staff was friendly and the room was as clean as you would expect a hotel room to be. 2 major needs: the toilet seats need to be upgraded to larger size and the hot water needs to be regulated better. I had to take my showers in phases as I waited for scalding water to subside every 30 seconds or so.,
-1|We loved our room. I paid extra for an upgrade that included a corner room and an ocean view. Believe it or not, I got both, and the view was gorgeous. However, we looked at the hotel from various spots on the grounds as well...
-1|We just returned after spending 6 days at this resort. The resort has apparently undergone a complete facelift and according to security personnel every room in the resort has been redone. The room we stayed in was simple but adequate with a shared balcony overlooking...
-1|Okish hotel. Some things have been updated but the interiors could do with a revamp. Shower painfully slow even after prompt attention from the maintenance man. Brilliant place for surfers I would imagine.
-1|We had originally booked at the PB Surf Beachside Inn, but the afternoon prior to our arrival I received a call from the front desk informing me we were being moved to the sister property a block away. I was not thrilled with the change as I had spent many hours pondering, looking at pictures, maps, and reviews on the internet before making the selection. When we arrived and saw the room, it was nice enough, but you could tell it was only halfway remodeled. There we obvious upgrades, nice BIG new TV, nice little fridge and microwave, however the old curtains were still up, and the floor was carpeted, not tiled. The bathroom was upgraded, but also unfinished, as the shower grout and chalking was not finished around the bottom....which allowed water flow out the shower, under the wall and into the carpet in the room. We discovered this as our socks got soaked as we walked into the bathroom across the soggy carpet.Front desk was very helpful. When we turned our TV on, there was no cable. When we called the front desk, she cheerfully came down and immediately found the problem, the cable was not plugged into the TV. She also told us to let management know about the leaky shower when we checked out...which we did, and they got us a reasonable discount.The location is superb! It's a couple minutes walk to the beach, and there is a nice grassy park above the beach on the little bluff with great views. Many reasonably priced restaurants in walking distance.We will be back, and hope to get a fully finished room...at which point the review will be 4 or 5 instead of 3!Of course, we would love to receive a 5! But, I do understand your issues, and I believe I met you while I was picking up some paperwork at the desk. Please just give me a call the next time, and we'll make sure you get a fully renovated room! Thank you! And, btw, we did take care of the issues you told us about! Thank you.,
-1|After getting the bait and switch I decided I'd rather stay anywhere else. I'm sure I wasnt missing much as it looks like project style crack house apartments. The front desk (old middle eastern lady) was extremely rude and up charged me 50 when I got there! I travel and stay in hotels 250 days/ year and trust me
-1|We had no choice but to stay here when a tornado hit the area and most of Vineland was without power. They charged us 190 for one night, wouldn't accept my AAA card and after leaving, we found out, we had been charged for 4 cats (which we don't own) and for another person.
-1|Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel.
-1|Horrible neighborhood and rooms were unclean
-1|Garbage hotel beware do not use the toxic water there if you shower in it you will smell like waste water
-1|This hotel has bedbugs!! The staff acted like it wasn't a big idea!! Don't stay here!!
-1|The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care
-1|A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room.
-1|When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out.
-1| I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel.
-1|It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke
-1|Shower flow rate was low - just a trickle. Hot water was luke-warm at best - no "hot" water. Shower drain was in the middle of a flat tiled shower floor sloping toward the back end of the shower where water puddled up and did not drain, leaving soap scum, etc. - very unsanitary.
-1|Bathroom sink did not drain well, leaving shaving cream, soap scum, whiskers in sink after shaving by the time it drained - and the drain had a "sewer" smell. There were unrepaired holes in the drywall at the bathroom door jamb. I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying!
-1|I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying! Refrigerator made a loud humming noise - on and off about every 3-5 seconds. No continental breakfast included (unless you want to pay $9 to have it delivered to your room.)
-1|The palm tree trimmers did not cover the hot tub that day, so they had dropped palm tree trimmings into the hot tub rendering it unusable. The pool cleaning company was there the next evening to clean it out.
-1|dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel.
-1|The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area
-1| had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent.
-1|We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room.
-1|I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn.
-1|We had a cockroach in our room the last night we stayed there, and thank god it was the last night. They clearly do not have a pest control contract that treats the place for roaches regularly enough.
-1|No ironing board in room at check-in - Maid turned off my room refrigerator for no reason -- stuff inside got warm - No way to set time manually on alarm clock -- it was a constant 1hr 40min behind
-1| I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation.
-1|It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel. No one told me.
-1|he WIFI was slow, and unreliable, cutting out from time to time. Also, when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI, it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor. BTW, you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect (eg if you generate an unacceptable password)
-1|The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow, and a printer as well that lumbers along. Old, slow, out of date.
-1|The Room Carpets were OLD, worn, very WORN and STAINED
-1|The lead clerk at the desk during check in was rude, abject Rude in her attempts to be prim and proper
-1|The clerk at the desk during check out was outwardly rude, abjectly Rude. She made my wife and I go back and forth between the hotel and the restaurant. We absolutely should not have been involved in that, at all. attempts to be prim and proper
-1|Bathroom was small, noisy outside
-1|At the arrival, we paid the parking fee in cash (43) and the rest of the amount for two nights stay with a credit card. Checking the transactions during the last couple of days we realized that the parking fee has been charged on the credit card TOO. We asked for an explanation and have not received any answer at all. It's simply unacceptable.
-1|The room furniture is old, need a renovation. The space around all windows - both in the room and the shower - and the windows themselves were very dirty. Basically no choice for breakfast - consisted of two types of cereal, boiled eggs, white and whole grain bread
