1|Great staff and rooms. Housekeeping was always spot on--we never saw them come in, and it was in perfect order when we came back to our rooms. The hotel is close to everything, French Quarter, museums, business district, etc. And we got a GREAT price for our stay. It's an excellent value--highly recommend to anyone visiting New Orleans!
1|Very accommodating staff. Competitive pricing for downtown N.O. convenient location. Comfortable room. Good food in restaurant. Broken exercise equipment. 'fitness club' is a bit of a misnomer. We can recommend this to anyone else for a good place to stay with great location for many attractions.
1|Room was much larger than I expected, and water and fridge were offered for my room - had everything I needed. Nice basic breakfast was included. Room was very clean and everyone here was friendly! Would stay again. ,
1|This is an old hotel in very good location. A 5 minute walk to Bourbon Street and Harrahs' Casino. A 15 min walk will get you to Caffe DuMonde and the French Market. Although old, the hotel is well kept and the staff is efficient. I found the room a little bit small, but confortable.
1|The hotel is historic and yet modern. Full of history. The hotel is conveniently located in the heart of New Orleans. Blocks from the French Quater and the Riverfront. The staff was very courtis and very knowledgeable. Always there to help get you where you want to be. Just one block to Mothers one of the local best restaurants. Totally enjoyed my stay
1|This hotel aptly named the Whitney Hotel as it was the location of the Whitney Bank.Several of the features of the bank era are there to be seen such as the strong room doors and related features.This hotel is in a very good location very close to local transportation - buses and streetcars.A short walk takes you to many places to eat, drink and shop.Less than ten minutes walk to Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street.Pleasant ambience, friendly staff and comfortable rooms. We had a noisy air con and after underlining our concerns were moved to another room and provided with free on the house breakfast.The hotel has partnership with some eating/licensed businesses plus a two for one offer for Mardi Gras World.
1|Such a beautiful hotel! LOVED the lobby and the bank vault. It was so unique and interesting. Our suite was so beautiful and very comfortable. We would like to thank the staff for taking such good care of us.Your knowledge of your wonderful city was so helpful.
1|Our room was beautiful, the location was wonderful just a couple of blocks from shopping, Bourbon Street and an easy walk to Jackson Square. There are great restaurants in walking distance as well as the restaurant in the hotel. Dinner in the vault was fabulous.The service was outstanding.Even one of the maintenance men held doors for me and gave great advice on where to eat. Loved it and can't wait to go back. Thanks especially to Jason who really took great care of us.
1|Excellent service and location was perfect. Have been in New Orleans numerous times so we didnt need to be in the heart of French Quarter which could be very noisy. dont get me wrong, love a good time let the good times roll but when I want to sleep I prefer quite.. Staff very helpful , great new restaurants in warehouse district....
1|Recently stayed at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans. The hotel was an exceptional experience from the old 1910 building to the amazing queen suite. We would make any future visits to New Orleans included a stay at the Whitney Hotel. Front desk staff helpful, friendly and very informational about locations in the city. Parking was somewhat priced out there but the valet service took good care of our truck and promptly brought it to us when we called for it. Would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to experience New Orleans in actual history and ambience.,
1|What a wonderful weekend spent with my husband. Staff, Food, Rooms, everything was great. So welcoming and professional from arriving to departure. Location is perfect. Not to busy, but many thing within walking distance to explore in the big city. Defiantly will be back soon... Wouldn't stay anywhere else! ,
1|This was a beautiful hotel. All the things that made it a bank are still there, reminding you of the lovely banks that we used to have. The fact that part of the building is still an operating bank was a surprise. Everything was lovely. I did not eat in the restaurant because the rest of my party wanted to go other places , but we should have eaten there. We went to Mother's we had the worst meal that any of us ever had. I would highly recommend this hotel for a great stay its location.
1|My wife and I recently spent 5 nights at the Whitney Hotel. We chose it for its mid-way location between the WWII and the Ogden Art Museums, and the French Quarter. It is also only a block from the Charles St. trolley to the Garden District.Our 6th floor king-bed room was a little small by king standards, but didn't feel cramped. The only smallness inconvenience was a lack of night stand and light on one side of the bed (no room). The bed and pillows were excellent and the room clean. The bath room had ample space for both of our toiletry bags, and there was a nice tub/shower with great towels. The provided shampoo and other products were of high quality.Since our room was directly above Poydras Street, a busy thoroughfare, we expected some noise and on the first night, which coincided with a Saints NFL game, we got it. However the noise subsided about 10 PM after the game traffic cleared and each of the subsequent nights were pleasantly quiet. The A/C was efficient and quiet.This is a smaller hotel (compared with the mammoth nearby Sheraton) and the staff were always available and pleasant. There is a restaurant on the premises (we only had one breakfast there - very good) but many, many fine restaurants in all price ranges are within 5-10 min walking distance. I felt the hotel was a great value for the price and would gladly stay again.
1|Special birthday trip for 5 days. We narrowed our choices on Hotels.com to finally choose The Whitney. We stay at many 'upscale' hotels in our business travels, and wanted an 'experience'. Location - perfect, a couple of blocks to the French Quarter, 3 or 4 to the Riverwalk, great food nearby. Starting with Earl (the Pearl) checking us in, and Michelle (long brown hair) made us feel comfortable far beyond the typical experience. They were knowledgeable and available for any of our needs wants, as other staff including housekeeping, they are great!Cleanliness rates a 10+Southern Hospitality 10+,
1|The Hotel is within easy distance of both the French Quarter and the Warehouse district. This is a historic building built as a bank and office use, so rooms may be smaller than a normal hotel, but the building has character. The staff was 5 star by being attentive, friendly, and helpful. My room was very clean and comfortable. I will stay again.,
1|I had a great stay at the hotel, walking distance from everything good in new orleans, rooms are nice, building has charming status due to the old bank stuff, i would recommend the whitney to anyone! You if you look for a place to stay in new orleans go there!,
1|We enjoyed this lovely hotel. It was nice to go to breakfast and look up and see the beautiful architectural details. The bank vault of course was extraordinary. We learned that the hotel is still attached to a working bank. The restaurant was lovely and the bacon egg and cheese croissant was fresh and delicious. The room was nice enough and clean enough. We would definitely stay here again for a quick stay.
1|The Whitney is about five blocks or so from Canal and on to the bars and restaurants of the French Quarter. At night it is a quiet walk past hotels and office buildings once you cross canal returning home. The staff is very friendly in that way New Orleans is. There is a small restaurant for breakfast and coffee if it is raining outside. Rooms are nice and quiet. Would definitely stay again.
1|For my mother's 90th birthday, she wanted to go to New Orleans (has not been since 1959) and we had a fabulous time. My thanks to the Whitney for making her feel so special, absolutely everyone at the hotel was gracious, helpful, polite and fun. The hotel was completely booked, but our spacious rooms/bathrooms were cleaned promptly and it was not noisy. I highly recommend the Whitney Hotel for the perfect stay in New Orleans...
1|When my original room was not ready, staff upgraded me to suite, which was great, with one exception. Given the historic nature of the property, electrical outlets were not readily accessible. The location was great for the purpose of my trip. Everywhere I needed to go was w/in a block.,
1|I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this Hotel. The room was clean, quiet for sleeping and comfortable. Very convenient for transportation and access to popular locations. I did not use the restaurant facilities, I think there could be a little more promotion for the dining room.
1|I was in town for the Crescent City Classic. The Whitney Hotel is easy walking distance to the start of the 10K race. Also close to the French Quarter and the WWII museum. I like the Central Business District and this location is very central for my purposes, with St. Charles street car close by to the Quarter and the Garden District. Very good value compared to comparable hotels. I have stayed here twice before and will try to stay here again my next trip. Was a good hotel for me.,
1|Hotel is older but quite nice. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are well appointed and quite modern. There is a bit of traffic noise from the street (I was on the 3rd floor) but this is to be expected downtown in a major city. (plus I was there the day the St. Patrick's day parade occurred, and its route took it right by the corner of the hotel). I didn't use the restaurant but it looked very decent. It's quite close to the various things to do or a quick cab ride away if you don't want to walk. I would certainly stay there again.,
1|Stayed for one night. Hotel is in a great location to walk to Superdome for Saints game and have dinner at the great Restaurants in the warehouse district. Hotel is clean and quiet. Loved how the lobby and check in area still have the large safe and bank windows throughout.
1|Beautiful modern king city view suite. A few quirks like 12th floor check in and directions needed to leave. Staff was very nice and helpful 40 per night off site valet parking but it was pretty quick. Walking distance to Gaslight district. Close to waterfront and airport. Overall great value
1|This Sheraton hotel is very good. The rooms are very big and very clean. Air conditioner works excellent and it's a strong point. The service and people are the perfect. Parking lot avaiable and free. My suggestion is for breakfest, could bring more option of fruits. Just it, but it's very good.
1|We really enjoyed our stay at the Four Points. The hotel is well furnished, clean, and comfortable. The bathroom is generously sized and updated.I enjoyed the stair access in the lobby so that I didn't have to take the elevator constantly. Our door did not close all the way - we just had to make sure we pulled it completely closed.My only criticism was the toiletries in the shower and the shower handle are poorly placed. I hit my elbow a few times and the toiletries caddy makes it hard to wash your hair under the shower.
1|I used this hotel for an event we were having and Heather Gordon was amazing! She helped me coordinate 30 rooms and make sure that everybody had what they needed. The location was perfect since it was close enough to Gaslamp and Petco Park. Everyone enjoyed their stay and I enjoyed how easy it was to coordinate accommodations for 30 people. Thank you Heather and Sheraton!
1|I stayed here for one night with my wife and two little kids. We were given a corner room with two queen beds which provided more than enough space for us. We were able to fit the toddler bed into the bathroom like we usually do. I chose this place in spite of the 15 parking fee, no free breakfast, and close proximity to a strip club (as mentioned in prior reviews). The room was clean and spacious. The highlight for me was the amazing bed and pillows. I stay at many different hotels and if this is the standard for Four Points I am very impressed. We also ate at the Denny's right across the street and went to Sea World the next morning refreshed and ready.
1|This comfortable , well appointed hotel turned out to be a very good choice for my short stay in San Diego. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet and early evening 'Happy Hours' were unexpected surprises. Casual dining at the bar or at the tables near the pool was ideal. The free wifi was appreciated but I was a little disappointed that the courtesy shuttle to and from the airport has been discontinued. The hotel is only a 15 min walk from the delights of the San Diego Old Town. The Transit Centre offers a choice of bus or Trolley downtown, or a no 30 bus for the 30 minute ride to La Jolla. A day pass covering both buses and trolleys is great value. With the distances between attractions in San Diego cab rides can be expensive.
1|Having recently spent 45 days at this Hotel, and having been there for an extended stay prior to this trip, I feel uniquely qualified to write this review. First, I found the Staff to be extremely friendly, helpful and professional, always quick to respond to my requests and needs. Being a single, older woman, I was delighted to feel safe and secure during my stay. The room was clean and the appearance pleasing, the bed was very comfortable, and breakfast in the mornings was always good. In the late afternoon, it was fun having 'Happy Hour' with great prices on wine and a light food selection. I appreciated that there are washers and dryers located on each floor. The Hotel is near all of San Diego's most sought after sites, shopping, Old Town and it's a breeze to jump on freeways to go anyplace. I will most certainly be staying at the Four Points again.
1|The A/C unit under the window blows air directly on the bed. I like it cold when I sleep but in order to have the A/C on when I sleep it blows a wind chill on me in bed. I had to move yhe room chair in front of the A/C to block the air flow.
1|We really enjoyed our stay at the Hampton Inn Mission Valley. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. We especially enjoyed the wonderful complimentary breakfast every morning. There is also a pool, hot tub and fire pit. We will definitely stay here again!,
1|This is a pretty new property that is conveniently located to Seaworld, downtown, and La Jolla. Staff was mostly polite, especially the breakfast staff. The room was clean. I liked the shower enclosure in the bathroom and the electronics charging station on the nightstand. The mattress was a bit firm for my taste. The only thing missing is a microwave in the room. Parking is 16/day, which is questionable. Breakfast was adequate--continental-type items, plus waffles, oatmeal, breakfast potatoes, eggs.
1|The hotel is ok but considering you pay 19 a day for parking it should be better. There aren't many normal parking spots. You frequently end up in a parking structure in the back and walking stairs to reach your car. Breakfast is as expected at any similar property. Very busy on the weekend. And no matter how busy it is at 10am the doors will be locked. We were done but several people missed out. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Housekeeping pounded on our door and brought us towels at night we didn't ask for and when we told the front desk they acted like it was our fault for not refusing the towels.
1|I have to say that I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. The customer service was excellent, the staff friendly and attended to my needs with a prompt response. Breakfast was also very good, rooms clean and overall appearance of the facility was impressive to say the least. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to San Diego.
1|We enjoy a lot our stay, I went whit my family and it was perfect. We ate a delicious breakfast ande the bed, the bathroom, the quiet was awesome. My family and I love Hampton Inn and in this opportunity it was the best.
1|The hotel is clean and the staff was excellent. There is no shuttle service but you can Uber for pretty cheap. The airport is only about 10 minutes away. The 18 a night for parking is absolutely ridiculous!! The hotel is close to most of the San Diego attractions including old town San Diego.
1|Very good hotel with easy access. Parking can be tight for 14/night when coming back late at night but there is room in the back. Surprised at the quality of the breakfast - get there early - and the pool area. Staff was very good.
1|Stayed here for a week (Sat. to Sat.) while visiting San Diego. The hotel was clean and free breakfast was great. The hotel seemed to be newer as evident by the modern decor.For those traveling with small children, our room only had a shower. Our 2 yr. old has only taken baths so he had to quickly get used to a shower, which did not end up being too bad for us. Location is excellent as you are 10 minutes from Sea World, Zoo, Balboa Park, USS Midway and much more. Parking is usually 16 a night but when we checked in they gave it to us for 10 a night! We rented a Hyundai Elantra and anything bigger would have been a pain to park as spaces seem very tight. This was not only at the hotel, but pretty much anywhere we parked in San Diego.
1|Likely the fanciest Hampton I have ever stayed in. Very large property, very modern and clean with a huge common area off the lobby. I think this Hampton may have the most awesome breakfast buffet in terms of size I have ever seen, and I have stayed at a LOT of Hamptons. Triple waffle iron area with 4 times the variety of toppings... say wahIn all seriousness, the rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The entire property was. The front desk staff was super friendly and welcoming. It felt like an upscale Hampton here.Now, they lost one star for two reasons - parking, they charge. To me it is insane to charge a customer for parking unless you are MAYBE downtown where I get parking is a commodity. This is Hotel Circle for crying out loud and they charge 18 bucks a day which is ridiculous. I have status with Hilton so they did lower my parking to 10 per day but it was still annoying and felt like they were simply trying to generate more revenue... particularly due to there was PLENTY of parking. The other reason was the housekeeping. We were there four nights and I had to call for housekeeping to come clean up my room. My husband had spilled a little something on the sheets and I was very surprised that they did not flip out the bottom sheet. Nope, left the stain there which was kind of gross. When they finally did clean, it was a half-hearted job, no toiletry or coffee refills, half the towels, etc. The front desk always came through for me though so it was not that big of a deal in the bigger scheme of things.,
1|The location of the hotel was central to all of the surrounding attractions. We definitely loved the beautiful weather. The staff was very nice and were willing to help or assist when needed. I will definitely be back.
1|#NAME?, close to all restaurants, 7 mins away from OLD town, 10 minutes from downtown, 15 from the beach. - Free Breakfast is a must - Very Friendly staff on the floor and kitchen,
1|Location is easy to get to and even though the room is small it met our needs.Staff is very friendly and helpful in assisting any requests we had.Room was in need of a carpet vacuum - which was not done during the 3 days we were there.
1|Best hotel ever. Right by mission bay beach. Rooms are beautiful extremely clean. Parking could be larger but manageable. Definitely a 4 star hotel n Hampton is always a pleaser to stay at while on vacation.
1|Excellent service.. Very welcoming staff. Always smiling and willing to assist in any way. I traveled without my husband and took my three sons and a friend of there's and we all survived the stay without any casualties
1|Stayed at this Hampton with my family for College Tour at UCSD and SDSU. It's a great location, very centrally located to the colleges, downtown, restaurants and beaches. It located on what's called Hotel Circle. I will definitely stay there again next time in SD. Room was very clean and everything works as it should. Free WiFi could be faster speed but that's minor.
1|I was traveling to see my son graduate from Marine boot camp and I couldnt be more pleased with the friendly and helpful service I received from ALL the staff. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful with activity tips, dining, shopping etc.
1|This hotel is wonderful: friendly, helpful staff, very clean, nice decor with a good feel. Parking lot is easy in and out with plenty of parking close to the doors. The breakfast is as good as they always are at Hampton Inn's. There's something for everyone. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying the breakfast with as many choices as there are. I always appreciate the 24 hour coffee/tea station and little convenience store with everything you might need without having to leave the hotel. Rooms are super clean, quiet, and comfy!
1|We will use this hotel again. Great location. Right off freeway. All places we wanted to go were within 5 miles. Comfy bed. I thought pillows too flat (soft), but still slept well. While we were there it was pretty quiet. Our room faced a hotel that is being dismantled. My husband was awakened once by noise that was from there, but it was only for a few minutes. I wasn't disturbed by it. I would suggest asking for a room that did not face that way, especially if you are a light sleeper. The hotel and our room quite clean. From the reviews I read, I think the hotel is less than 2 years old. They have free wifi. Parking is 16 a day/night. There was plenty of parking. We stayed 8/23-8/26 (Sun-Thurs). During busier weekends or holidays not sure of parking situation or how quiet it would be. The breakfast is fantastic and staff kept all items stocked to 10am when the doors were closed. Many choices. Examples: Scrabbles eggs, sausage links, sausage patties, ham, gravy, biscuits, omelets, home style brkfst potatoes/hash brown dish, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, variety of fruit, muffins, bagels and breads (toast it yourself), make your own waffles, 4-5 different dry cereals, variety of yogurt cups, variety of coffee, tea, oj, apple juice, milk. Variety of jellies, cream cheese, creamers, sweeteners, peanut butter, honey, syrup, butter, margarine, etc. Every day we were there all the hot items were different. The hot egg, meat, potato dishes listed above were not all one day. There were four different items daily of the eggs, meat, and potato dishes. I figured at least 10-15 per person savings if we had to buy breakfast somewhere. All hotel staff very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the Old Town Trolley Tour. Check out all details on line. According to information, the trolley picks up at the hotel. We did not get that early of a start to be picked up at the hotel. Not sure when or where return would be for the trolley. For the times and things we did, it worked out better for us to park at Midway and get on trolley at that location.
1|We had a great experience here. For the money, you can't beat Hampton Inn Mission Valley. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast is the best I've had (and I stay at many hotels), and the rooms are clean and modern. The temperature is easy to control, and there were extra blankets in the closet. We got daily housekeeping service and they did a great job. There is a pool and hot tub, as well as a fire pit. The pool is smaller than it appears in the picture, but it was never overly crowded and my sons had a blast playing in it every night. The town is a short Uber ride away. There are two washers and dryers for guest use, but sometimes there is a wait. I would definitely stay again.,
1|The most important thing to us is the cleanliness of the hotel, and especially the room. We did not worry about anything as it was fresh and clean every day. The staff was all friendly at all times of the day. We arrived earlier than our check in time but our room was ready so that was good too.,
1|Besides Henry, the front desk employees and maid service was above and beyond expectation. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to this part of the U.S. The driving around the area was a bit difficult, however, the front desk took great care of giving excellent directions.
1|We chose this particular hotel because we had stayed in it last October '14. This time we brought our entire family to have a week long family celebration of our 50th wedding anniversary. The staff, for the most part, is different. But, even better than last time which was right after the grand opening. I'm telling you. You won't be disappointed. They really are a first class operation, kind, and considerate, especially to us older folks that need special handling.
1|Nice hotel. Easy check in and clean room. Slight deltas: hotel phone handset was sticky (would have never had touched it but the front desk left a welcome message). Shower water pressure was low. The desk chair was uncomfortable, seat pad was very thin. Sometimes road noise was notable. These minor issues were easily overcome/overlooked.,
1|Was greeted with a courteous staff. The room was clean and quiet. Breakfast was good, although a bit crowded at times. My only issue is the parking fee of 19... way too much! Similar properties less than a mile away did not have a parking fee.,
1|Very Hilton-y. I know what to expect. Good service. Updated rooms. Good amenities. When you travel a lot... consistency is fantastic and unpleasant surprises can be draining. Gold+ members get a great breakfast included. Super convenient to shopping, business and restaurants.,
1|The Hampton Inn (Mission Valley) in San Diego was a great choice for our family weekend getaway. It was close to the freeway as well as the San Diego Zoo, parks, and other attractions. The rooms were clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good - not great, but acceptable.
1|HI. everything was very nice. free wifi and free breakfast. the parking was not free though. the pool was warm and hot tub. there was not really any view but there was a good restaurant in the area named hunter steak house.
1|Hotel is in a great location for 5he purpose o my trip. Staff was very accommodating. Check in and check ou5 wa extremely easy. Internet work well, food was good, room was clean and quiet. Will stay here again if Im in San Diego
1|I stayed in this hotel with a group of 50 high school students. The staff was friendly, organized, and made the check-in process super easy, considering the size of my group. The were accommodating to all of our needs, even setting up a section of bus parking for us. The staff was also respectful to my students, which is not always the case. Many times hotels only address the adults, but Robbie took it upon himself to make sure they were comfortable.
1|Everything about this newer hotel was pretty nice. Two big detriments: 14 to park, which is ridiculous for a Hampton Inn. Really!! And the bathroom doors have automatic closers, which is terribly annoying, especially when you have little children with you. When I commented to the front desk clerk on checkout what a hassle this was, she said, Yeah. I know. It's a problem we're trying to work on, but with 182 rooms, it takes a lot to do all of them. I said, Well, you should at least provide a doorstop in the room. Her reply was, Oh, you could have asked for one. We have them here. Well, why on earth isn't there a notice to that effect in the room We could have avoided a lot of misery. Anyway, the staff was very nice. The breakfast was very good. We didn't have an opportunity to use the outdoor/pool area, but it looked very inviting with a nice lounge/conversation area. We'd probably stay here again, but we'd definitely ask for a doorstop if they haven't fixed the doors yet. (And we might try to strike a deal with the restaurant next door to park for less.)
1|Wonderful staff! Everyone was so nice, as well as helpful. Great location too! I have stayed at this hotel several times, and it's always been a great experience. It was fun to see the hotel decorated for the holidays.
1|This hotel is located in old town very close to airport. But San Diego airport and center of the city are very close to each other, so its very convenient. I could stay here with calm condition after my business and go to conversation center within 15 minutes by Uber. Im also very satisfied with courteous staffs.,
1|Great value, nice location. Easy access from San Diego airport, short drive to downtown and convention center area at a more reasonable price. Also enjoyed proximity to old town for restaurants and bars. Great area to stay and a clean, quiet, comfortable hotel.,
1|When we arrived, the exterior of the hotel was very colorful and set the tone for a relaxing stay. Christian and Lyle at the front desk were very welcoming. They offfered suggestions on where to eat and handed out some free appetizer coupons to local restaurants. This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service. The only drawbacks were you had to pay for nightly parking and the computers were very slow and the printer was not working. The rooms were clean and updated.,
1|We stayed from Wednesday to Friday in December 2017. Reservation was made on line. I also had a Friends Family Discount Voucher. Front Desk Rep would not accept it. Stated that the reservation was not made that way Explain Pls Just repeated what was said earlier. The reservations was made correctly with the Corporate Code. All I had to do was present Voucher upon check in Spoke to the Operations Director the next day. She couldn't do it either. And stated you got a good rate anyway I would have gotten a lower rate if they honored it and would have proven that the Corporate programs works. Oh well...Next issue parking fee of 20/night. Other Marriot Hotels waive the fee if you are a Calif. AAA member. Brought it up and was told: we don't do that here Ok, I can accept that. However, parking on property is underground and VERY LIMITED. If you drive in and no spaces, you need to back up all the way out. Had to park on the street both nights (which would have been FREE). Other than that, the room was clean and spacious enough. Closet space was small but adequate for the length of stay. I like the pull out desk/table. The shower soap was smallL. Could not get a good grasp on it. It was not larger than 2 flash drives end-to-end and just a little bit wider. That's it. I kept dropping it. The Bistro/Starbucks in the lobby was not open at 6 AM as posted so no eats if you need to hit the road early...,
1|The Courtyard San Diego Old Town is my new favorite hotel! The location is perfect - within easy walking distance (a few blocks) of the amazing restaurants and shops in Old Town. The front desk staff are very hospitable and eager to assist. The property is beautiful and the decor is true to the area. I enjoyed my stay here tremendously!
1|Only staying overnight for easy airport access for early morning flight. My business reason is always TJ and this Marriott works for my departures and keeps my rewards points coming. I plan to keep using unless a problem starts happening that cannot be fixed by Marriott management.
1|Our reservations were made the day before we traveled. Arrived around 9:00 at night, staff very friendly and ready to help. Room was clean and ready. There was no iron in the room, staff immediately brought one to the room. Room was cleaned daily, nothing went missing. Hotel is right next to the freeway. The room was quiet and traffic noise wasn't a problem.
1|Overall very nice property with friendly staff and good parking options. Walking distance to Old Town San Diego that has an abundance of restaurant choices, stores, and sites. The hotel is also very close to the airport (less than 5 minutes) and a short drive to numerous nearby attractions.
1|Very convenient to the airport. Clean rooms. Friendly staff but a bit off on their directions to restaurants in Old Towne. Pizza flyer under the door so someone wondering the halls was not a great feeling. Could use a bit of updating. Had a glass of wine in the lobby area and the service was friendly and entertaining.
1|The hotel is really nice the restaurants have a great food and the staff is excellent. The location makes it easy to get to anywhere been in downtown San Diego and the area is located with several nice restaurants to choose from .
1|Stayed here for 4 nights in Nov and absolutely loved it! Great rooms, great staff, great location (right in Gas Lamp area), great bar and restaurant. Will definitely stay here again when I'm back in San Diego (soon, hopefully). A lovely place to come back...,
1|I enjoyed my stay here. This hotel is exactly what you would expect based on the price. The Good great location that is within 10 minutes to all (zoo, seaworld, petco, jolla, beaches), nice pool and hot tub area, ample parking spots (just not after 12 as expected), and reasonable price. The Bad not the most plush bed but exactly what I expected. If you're looking for location + price, this is the place for you
1|Awesome hotel in the circle perfect located 10 min from the Zoo 10 min from Seaworld and 5 min walk from the mall ! Great room awesome pool, gym and breakfast ! Will stay here again ! Great service aswell ! Free Parking, clean rooms and close To mini mart !!! Free wifi
1|I took my almost 13 year old niece to San Diego. We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable. There is a plug issue with two outlets where refrig, blow dryer and coffee maker plug in. It wasn't too much of an issue because we just unplugged the refrig when we briefly needed the other appliances. Mirrors didn't bother us and they do make the room feel larger. Room was very clean, bedding was clean and of fairly good guality. Probably the biggest negative was thin walls and doors that you could not close quietly. So we heard noise above us and we were bolted awake one morning by a neighbor 's slamming door at 6:30am. Plenty of free parking. beautiful grounds, sparkling clean pool, nice jacuzzi and great location. Hotel shuttle driver was very nice and reception crew was always helpful. I also appreciated the free computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes. I would stay at this hotel on another trip to San Diego.
1|Due to LOSSAN performing track maintenance, I wound up spending a few days in San Diego. When I saw the rate, I grabbed it because, honestly, I was curious.What really makes this hotel good is the staff. That goes double with the staff at the restaurant who really stood out and made the place great.The room was good, but not great. It did, however get the job done and I was well rested and got some work done. Under the right circumstances, I would stay again.,
1|I have had the pleasure to stay here on business and with my family on our weekend getaways! As always, the staff are professional, polite and very helpful to ensure my/our stay is the best possible. I am scheduled to return at the end of the month,.
1|Stayed at the Seven Seas for three nights en route to Los Angeles and San Francisco, yes it could do with updating but you get what you pay for. Hotels near to the city centre are much more expensive and it only cost 9 dollars in an uber to the harbour plus the bus terminus is only ten minutes walk with frequent travel to the centre. Our stay was comfortable and the staff helpful and polite, no problems with the room It was clean and roomy and you also have free on site parking which is a bonus. A couple of small swimming pools if you would like a relaxing dip and well kept gardens throughout the location. On site restaurant and bar which we didn't use as we were out early and back late. Easy to find just off the freeway would definitely stay again when visiting the area.
1|I was pleasantly surprised and how nice the property is with a nice jungle type of setting for the landscaping. Very lush/green areas and the rooms are very comfortable and basic. It's a good value if you book early enough to get a good deal for this pretty place. They also have a good cafe/restaurant next door you can have...
1|I had a three day seminar, down the road, under the bridge and across the street. It was a pleasure to spend half the money and still be in walking distance of the seminar. The room was small but definitely workable. The grounds were beautiful and it was a pleasure to walk through there every morning and each evening. The staff were cheerful and helpful.
1|The Best Western Seven Seas was very convenient, easy on and off freeway access. It is only a short distance to the airport parking. We had pre-paid for our room and upon arrival found out that our room had been up graded at no additional charge. Had a king size bed with a balcony and had only paid for queen size bed. pleasant surprise.,
1|We were thrilled to find availability at this hotel, as we booked it the week before our trip. Most hotels were sold out in the area, so we were pleasantly surprised to find comfortable, clean, and hospitable accommodations. We loved the location, which was within a couple miles of Old Town San Diego. If we ever need to return, I will definitely book this hotel.
1|We were 4 women in a room with two double beds, in town for 4 days for a convention at the Town Country, happening just on the other side of the I-8 freeway. I'd say mostly positives for us! The property was obviously being attended to while we there, with gardeners replanting and pruning the day we were leaving, the exterior building was being washed down. Very nice plantings all about. Cafe, very satisfactory. Free parking very welcome. Our convention was only a 5 or so minute walk away. We were anticipating free breakfast with the reservation (was discussed when reservation was placed) but because we didn't have documentation of that, we weren't able to counter the front desk assertion that we did not have breakfast with the reservation. So be prepared with your paperwork. Just about once a day, 1 or more of us had our room key cards not work, so we had to go to the front desk to have them reset somewhat tiresome especially because we were housed in the furthest bank of rooms from the office. For the room, yes per other reviews, the a/c is set up such that it's an uneven situation, especially at night when sleeping. We dealt with it. Some sort of problem with shower pipes in the room above, when at 3 and 4 in the morning (!), a loud rattling pipes noise commenced, for a good 10 minutes. We alerted the front desk to the problem in the morning. The noise did not occur the next evening, but it could have been because then there was no one in the room upstairs afterwards during the span of our stay. Sure parking was very tight on the Saturday evening, but it was Saturday night, late we did eventually find a spot.Frig worked well. Plenty of towels. Room didn't at all seem overly dated. Beds were satisfactory. We indulged in the pool one late afternoon, but it ended up being the same time as what appeared to be a family reunion so shifted after a little bit to one of the hot tubs. Very nice nonetheless to have a pool and 2 hot tub options on the property. There is also a small gym facility adjacent to the pool.We would stay here again!
1|My friend and I have stayed here twice on two different trips to the San Diego area. It is close to downtown San Diego and Ocean Beach which is important to me. We eat over in Ocean Beach but see theatre shows in San Diego. They did not have any 2 Queen bed rooms available upon check in this past visit but upgraded us for free to a King size bed which worked out perfectly. The rooms are dark (can make them dark for sleeping), clean and no bed bugs as I check before bringing in my luggage. I always wish we could stay more than one night as it's my number one choice of a place to stay in the San Diego area. Some hotels charge you for parking which I just dislike. I did my research before staying here the first time and it paid off. We had a horrible experience up in Vista and did not want a repeat of another crappy hotel. Next trip down to San Diego for another theatre show we will be staying here again. Can't recommend this place enough! It's easy freeway access off/on the 8 along hotel row.,
1|we stayed here for 4 nights and loved the free wifi, good coverage for TV - tiny tiny bathroom with the sink outside of the bathroom which works well for us, no closet doors there was a fridge in the room and a coffee pot -lots of drawer space, a restaurant and bar on site and free parking - located in hotel circle amongst lots of other hotels -- not really walking distance to anything of interest but easy driving to a huge mall -- one odd thing is that there are two stairs to get to the ground floor rooms from the handicap parking space - good value - very clean - took ages to check in and out - they have all the info they can use before you get there why dont they use it Breakfast was not included in our rate so ask - you may save a ton of money by going elsewhere to eat
1|Wanted a cheap but clean place to stay, and this place worked just fine. They have a free shuttle service which was great. The rooms were cleaner than I expected for the low price I paid, so I was happy about that. However, they could stand to replace their bathroom doors as they are old! The pool and property were nice as well. Staff was friendly. Would stay here again, especially with their great prices.,
1|Amazing it was the very best I could have stayed or do business in at San Diego. I am most impress as I don't really stay at a lot of great hotels like the best Western. First la jolla, next Mission Valley. I'm sure I'll be staying here again. and in different locations.,
1|Our stay was very nice. The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable. The grounds were clean and nice with all the green plants. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again. Also very close to Old Town and out attractions.
1|Overall the experience was good. I would stay there again. The grounds are beauitiful, I will stay there again in June 2015. Great resturants close by and good access to other interesting attractions.,
1|It was cheap. It was clean. It was nice. Good restaurants nearby. Seaworld, zoo, and whole lot of beaches no less than 15 min away from hotel. Cafe wasn't too bad either. Jacuzzi was nice as well. Would stay here again.
1|The girls at the front desk were efficient when we arrived, but by the time we had booked in, the 11 or so behind us didn't look too happy as only 2 girls were there and the queue was growing very fast...Decor throughout the main part of the hotel is dated, but well maintained and clean. The motel style units looked well worn out, but we were pleasantly surprised at the fresh decor and up market linens and drapes in our room, which was spotlessly clean and cleaned every day we stayed there.The pool and spa pools are beautiful. I didn't use the fitness room as looked a bit 'testosterone laden' with too many men working out for me, but the pool was clean and warm.It's in a strange situation on 'the Hotel Circle' which literally is a circular route of hotels with an elevated highway running alongside them, about 3-4 miles from downtown, so there is a bit of traffic noise, but Downtown hotels are ALL on the flight path of either the Navy airstrip or the international airport! If you are a light sleeper, ask for rooms in the 210-224's as these are quietest and not poolside either. We slept okay.
1|There were some areas great and some were not. We still enjoy the most of them. The location of the hotel was great and very easy access to all amenities. Our best overall service that we were enjoying most was the shuttle drivers. They were very helpful and care a lot to all areas of the service. We all recommended them the best. The second area we enjoyed as well was the dinning in area especially outside. The coffee was great we love it the most too. The service there was great too. Our rooms were good just not much space to move from one end to another but other than that it was okay. The only two areas that we weren't enjoying at all was at the reception area just one receptionist that was very helpful, her attitude was too good at all, she never smile and not helpful too. The other area that we weren't enjoyed was around the all rooms the smoking cannabis it was horrible and very bad, outside where we were staying when open the door we couldn't breath because of the horrible smell as well as people have no respect to other people around.
1|Location was great, hotel circle. Very close to everything. Room a little small. Would get up to use restroom in the middle of the night and kept running into the chair. Just my husband and I. Daughter and her husband and three kids in another rooom. Air conditioning didn't work very well in either room..,
1|We needed a hotel with airport transportation arriving rather late in the evening, and this came up online. The bus took awhile to pick us up but the driver was very pleasant and took my husband back to pick up our rental car next morning, and to the airport for a very early flight after our second stay Sunday night. The hotel grounds were attractive, room adequate and breakfast very good, with a discount. Would use it again for a before or after flight motel at half the airport hotel price.,
1|I enjoyed one of the two hot tubs being open late. The cute theme and color coordinated dcor inside and outside of the buildings put me into relaxation mode. The diner on site is convenient. I slept comfortably in the bed. It was over all a quite restful environment.
1|While looking for affordable accommodations in this area, I kept finding places that charged extra for parking, which is something that just rubs me the wrong way. Best Western Seven Seas has plenty of convenient parking, and I was able to park either right in front of our door, or at worst, a couple of spaces down. The room was average size and clean, the a/c worked and the shower had good pressure. Nothing fancy but all that we needed, and a good value for the area. It was very convenient to the freeway and we were able to get in and out easily. I took morning walks in the area and I did notice that most of the other hotels on Hotel Circle S also had free parking, but none had such a large and nice complex. I didn't utilize the pool or the hot tub, but I did see that many guests were, and both areas looked well maintained. A young man did come in while I was checking in asking if they had a basketball to go with the basketball hoop. They didn't, so if you think you or your kids want to shoot some hoops, bring your own ball. It is not a court, but just a simple hoop at the end of the parking lot.I will stay there again if in the area.
1|The Best Western Seven Seas is a great place to stay in San Diego. There is a nice pool and spa. My son likes that there is a restaurant on the property and room service. This hotel is conveniently looked to all the sites of San Diego and a great shopping center!
1|Was pleased with room, it was clean, bed comfortable. The convenience of having on site restaurant was a plus. Food was good and prices reasonable. Wish i had time to enjoy pool and jacuzzi. Convenient location.
1|First time guest at this very pleasant hotel. Grounds are well manicured and nicely layed out. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with a trendy decor. Bathrooms a little dated, but very clean. I usually stay at BW Plus hotels, but this property offered all the amenties I've received in the Plus hotels in a great location for my business trip at an attractive rate. Close to mall, restaurants Quallcom Stadium. Close enough to the airport, without the airport noise. Multiple 2 story walk up buildings. Recommend rooms on the first floor, although car lights could shine into the room if your drapes are open. Staff was friendly, courteous and very professional.
1|This is a GREAT Hotel! I found this reasonably priced hotel and was very satisfied with my stay. I'm a tough customer. Fair but tough. The rooms are clean. Beds were comfortable. Newly renovated Restaurant and Pool. Parking is good. The grounds are tropical and well kept. The only thing I would want is a renovated bathroom in the rooms. A simple upgrade of tile and new countertops and fixtures would make this property even better. I will definitely stay here when I am in town again.
1|This hotel is close to everything shopping ---beaches--zoo-- Balboa Park and only thirty minutes from Legoland. The beds were comfortable and the pool was warm along with two hot tubs one just for adults another where the pool is located.They also had a restaurant and a choice to buy discounted tickets for attractions.also they had Washers and dryers for those wet sandy clothes from the beach.. Thanks would stay here again.
1|Spent a couple of nights here during our stay in San Diego. The hotel is well located near attractions and shopping and easily accessible to highways. It is not a new facility but it appears to be cared for. Beautiful grounds with a nice pool area and two hot tubs. Very helpful staff and a clean facility. We were pleased with our stay.
1|Perfect location with easy access to all of San Diego and free shuttle. Surrounded by palm trees, great hot tubs and pool, friendly, accommodating staff, excellent food, Zack's bar is cozy and fun, room is comfortable with everything you need.
1|A chain Hotel but never the less good value for money with large rooms, quiet ambience, a good pool, restaurant and polite staff. Close to the freeways in San Diego's Hotel circle, the Hotel is easily accessible, it's close to the Fashion Valley shopping Mall, it's on the Downtown Trolley route and although it gets busy, it's never overcrowded. A good value for money Hotel away from the busy beach areas. The Restaurant is good value too.,
1|We stayed here for a few days in November. All three rooms were nothing less than spectacular. Our rate was awesome through PRICELINE and was under 40.00. The facilities are spotless and the location is super... the crossroads of San Diego... two malls just 2 miles away, great cuisine up the hill and access to the pool and whirlpools were also great.Free parking and everyone we encountered was very nice.We'd pay a little more to stay there again.,
1|This hotel is located such that it's fairly easy to get to most parts of San Diego. The hotel is a little older, but it is kept up well. Food at the diner is a little on the expensive side (NO CONTINENTAL BREAKFAST!!), but the staff are friendly. The room we were in was clean and wasn't too noisy.
1|Very nice room, clean and well taken care of. The grounds were very well taken care of with beautiful tropical flowers and palm trees. It was our third stay in 3 years and were again very happy. The heated pool and two hot tubs were awesome.,
1|I don't know how they do it. I own a small lodging facility in Alaska and there's no way I could offer this quality for this price. For an aging property, they have done very well with modest rates to manage the upkeep and maintenance. I walked in to my room this time thinking, I don't remember this higher-quality tile...
1|Staff was great. Close by so many attractions. FREE parking and FREE WiFi. Rooms are decent for what youre paying. No complimentary breakfast, no acces to a microwave. Other than that it was a great experience, had no trouble at Check out.
1|The rooms are always clean and comfortable. I love the fact that it is several little buildings motel like but Best Western Style. So you walk out of your room right outside through beautifully manicured greenery that are tropical like and CA style. It is low key yet comfortable. The pool has no chlorine and water doesn't smell awful seems...
1|Nice , CLEAN, friendly, nice price. I wish the airconditon is not so loud. :) The BW Seven seas in San Diego is the third of the Best Western hotels that I visited and found that each of them is very clean :).Thanks to those ladies who do their part well. I'll be back BW! :)
1|Hotel is very nice and accommodating. We arrived two hours early and we were able to get right in our room. The grounds are very nice and clean. We found our room to be comfortable for our needs. It does not have a microwave, but it did have a mini fridge. We would definitely stay here again. The staff was very friendly and always available for questions.,
1|Feel secluded with surrounding lush green plants, palm trees and very friendly staff. Caf dining, cocktail lounge, swimming pool/hot therapy pool, fitness center and room service if needed. What more could you ask for at an afforded rate! Loved it!,
1|This is a great location and easy on/off from the highway. The zoo is under 3 miles away and Petco Park is under 5. There are other sights close by as well. If you want to minimize your driving in San Diego and still drive to some vacation spots, this is a great choice. Nice pool. No breakfast included but they have a restaurant. Also many other motels within walking distance that also have restaurants.,
1|Beautiful grounds and gardens once you check in you are in Paradise. Welcoming staff from the front desk to the hospitality to the maintenance. Pool area largest in the area you don't feel like you are on top of the other guests.
1|The rooms are a bit small but the hotel is about ten minutes away from the airport. I like that it was near the North Park area, so its a great location if you are catching a flight out of Lindbergh Field and have a car to get around. Probably not the best place if you want to spend a night partying in San Diego.,
1|I checked in for one night over a July weekend and found the staff at the front desk to be very helpful. The clerk asked me where I'd prefer my room and I asked for somewhere quieter. She was able to put me in a room further away from the pool/stairs which was very great. The room was clean and smoke free as promised. The AC also worked very well. I would recommend earplugs if you go to bed early or want to sleep in, as other guests come back late and leave earlier for the near by attractions. During the night I couldn't hear anything from either neighboring room which was very nice!,
1|We checked in here for four nights before moving to our apartment in San Diego, this hotel is in hotel circle, so not many bars and restaurant are around, but its 20 mins walking distance to fashion valley, so if you love shopping, do take advantage of that! The Zacks bar in the hotel has happy hour every day from 4 to 7, we really liked that.
1|good service over all in the hotel in outside the hotel closed to my conference a walking distance, the restaurant got good service and good food, the room was clean, the parking no problem, and it was no smoking on the room it is excellent,
1|I visited this hotel twice with my family and we all loved it. Easy access on and off the freeway all while being a quiet and safe hotel. The room had upgraded new furnishings and there was a restaurant on site.
1|This is the first time I have ever been moved to write a hotel review, but this hotel far exceeded my expectations. It is in the same area as a number of other low-budget properties, and I have stayed in several because it is close to my daughter, but from this point forward I will always choose this hotel. The...
1|Overall great value for the price we paid. Rooms are clean, comfy beds, a little dated but I enjoy the retro look so worked for me!Highlight was definitely the heated pool and hot tub, our kids never wanted to leave...the grounds were beautiful and well kept. We ate at the restaurant 5 times and the food was good, nothing outstanding but hit the spot and service was great.Another bonus was that it was close to the fashion valley mall transit location so we were able to get around and see the sights and beaches with public transit easily and a day pass for adults was only 7. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to families with kids and travelling on a budget!,
1|Very clean and close to everything San Diego has to offer.Close to the freeway for access to everything. The restaurant had good food where we dined for breakfast and dinner on a few different occasions, Patrick was our server and was very accommodating and personable . The room was very clean and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. The price was more than reasonable and we will stay there again if we are in the San Diego area.,
1|The grounds are really pretty, the rooms are very nice and clean. The staff is very nice. The WiFi did not work well in my room. My room was in the 200 building around the back and it was very quiet. I was very impressed about the charges incurred if you smoke in the room- that is a great way to keep all rooms smoke free! The bathroom was very small. One thing I did not like was all the smoking at the pool- I ended up not going to the pool because of the number of people smoking. I also was disappointed that the hotel does not offer a free breakfast.,
1|great staff-heated pool-comfy bed-clean room and great location-disappointed with the wifi but otherwise it was very nice. There is a bar and a caf onsite-very convenient. Close to nearby attractions
1|Everything was excellent will definitely be going back soon the quality was great and the staff were very helpful and made everything easy for my family and I as soon as we got there they were very friendly and professional.
1|We really enjoyed staying in this room. It was very clean and the decor was nice. The location was not hard to find and it was nice and secluded. Area was nice and the outside was pretty. The staff was very helpful and happy. Overall amazing experience.
1|Stayed several nights in June 2012. (Check several sites on the Internet for the best rates under 100 a night. Compare to the Best Western site.)The hotel is more of a motel with exterior hallways and no elevators. The room was small, but clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable, but the mini fridge was quite small. I requested a quiet room since the hotel is next to the freeway. It had a smal pool and two hot tubs. The fitness center was a room next to the pool with only a half dozen treadmills, elipticals, and a few free weights. If you want a serious workout, ask about local gyms or jog along the bay. The grounds were nicely landscaped and the place was very clean.The hotel is minutes from the mall, Old Town, and the aforementioned freeway will start you on the way to Balboa Park. The freeway near Balboa is narrow and congested at times, particularly when the zoo closes and the downtown workforce heads home. Plan on traffic issues.There are many places to eat in the area--ask at the desk. Old Town is nearby, but there are also cheaper fast food places.
1|We moved to this hotel from two doors down and were extremely pleased. The rooms have been renovated in the past 2 months and were clean and fresh, albeit small. I recommend buildings 1|2, or 3. The grounds were lovely and calming and the pool was clean. Downsides: No continental breakfast, slow internet connection, a microwave didn't come with our room and the shuttle times weren't great for young children. Also, the TV channels were extremely limited, and there's no DVD player, but you can pay for Disney shows or Curious George at 4 each episode. We walked over to Bunz for food which was better than the restaurant. Great location, close to everything, but you need a car.
1|We have now stayed here three times and really like this place. While it is not on the water, it is close to the Pacific and most other attractions in San Diego. The staff are well trained and friendly and we actually are offered upgrades due to our BW Ride Rewards status. This does not happen at most BW hotels. The rooms are nice but a bit dated. We love the property since it really seems like a tropical resort. We come to San Diego quite often and will certainly make the BW Seven Seas our property of choice.,
1|Convenient to many different places to go. Shopping, airport, Beaches, Museums, Eateries, Everything ! The staff is very helpful, Zaks Bar is a fun place to sit and un-wind, The PG Lounge is seperate from the restaurant and you can sit out by the pool and lounge outside as well. They open up the large BBQ for guests, poolside, for fun. It's an older establishment, but they keep it up, and it's just right for the budget -oriented person, or, family ,when taking those trips to the amusement parks. Pretty close to everything. Centrally located !,
1|This is a wonderful hotel, a real tropical paradise in Mission Valley. The staff are very attentive and work to accommodate you. The rooms are nice with everything you need. I will always stay here when visiting San Diego!,
1|Wasnt used to this but ok. Will check account to make sure it drops off when you leave. Clean and pretty quiet. The restaurant made a special pizza for me that was tasty. Hotel is near Sea World and good for families.
1|I stayed at this motel from 7/11 - 7/16 2012 for Comic-Con. I was wary of it based on some negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location.
1|This hotel is not on or close to the strip but perfect if you are in Las Vegas to golf or sight see. We were not interested in being close to the strip and this hotel was perfect. It was clean and relatively new. The rooms were nice with new decor and the breakfast was good with enough selection for our needs. I would stay here again if we found ourselves in the area
1|Older hotel but very comfortable and a great staff, very helpful to any of your needs. Internet worked with no slow downs and the pool was inviting. The fitness roomwas great. I stayed there ten years ago and many of the same helpful staff are still working there.,
1|Great location. Was close to downtown Sam Diego and had numerous shops and restaurants nearby. Room was clean and comfortable. Only negative was that we needed to use the laundry facilities and they were perpetually busy during the evening. What should have taken 1 hour took much longer as we had to wait for machines. Management should consider extwnding this facility.
1|Went to San Diego for a few days to go on a Pelagic Birding trip. Registered at the Best Western Seven Seas. Beautiful setting. Felt like I wasn't in the city at all. Right by the Interstate, it was still quiet. The grounds, well kept, were like a tropical paradise. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The staff in...
1|This hotel is centrally located close to the many attractions that San Diego has to offer. The staff was very friendly and efficient. I was traveling with a group of just over 20 people and upon our arrival they had all our rooms ready for check in. But, not only that, they also had all our keys labeled with our names and room numbers already on them. That made for such a smooth registration and check in (as well as check out). Our stay was for 4 days and 3 nights. Another convenience the hotel provided was a shuttle ride to and from the SD Zoo. Eliminating the chore of fighting through traffic, driving (in an unfamiliar area), and parking. The rooms were well maintained, clean and had small refrigerators in each room. The hotel also has a pool (which we didn't have time to use) and a restaurant serving home cooked meals on site. I also liked that it was quiet.
1|Even though I was on Hotel Circle which is right off the main highway, the Seven Seas is at the very end and quiet. My room was on the back side and after spending the previous two nights at a BB right under the flight line for the airport it was nice to sleep in past 6:30 am. Beautiful landscaping and the restaurant staff were very nice. Everything very clean,
1|we enjoy staying at the Best Western Seven Seas have done so for many years we are treated like family We always enjoy the Seven Seas Best Western they treat you like family they have a nice pool and fitness center and everything is near the bartenders are great had fun
1|Good location for getting around the San Diego area. Priced fairly. If your a couple and you can, get the king room. Nice pool area and bar lounge. Decent restaurant on site. Don't go for the fitness center.,
1|Very good value. They have gone above and beyond to create a nice outdoor environment with a hawaiian feel. Bar could use some serious renovations. Although they had beer on tap I chose to avoid the bar because it was just depressing. Bed was comfortable, good pillows.,
1|I needed a place to stay near Old Town, San Diego and selected the Best Western Seven Seas. Yes, It is a bit outdated, but a good value for the money. I need to say that when I booked, Comic Con was going on in San Diego. So, I was left with few choices. Best Western Seven Seas came through. This time my stay was great. The room was fine. I was able to use their shuttle bus to take us to Old Town and pick us up afterward. Hotel staff are pleasant and willing to assist. The restaurant is good. No complaints.
1|Everything was great with my stay, However upon taking our first shower the soap holder fell off the wall. As is it was freshly put on that day, No apologies or anything. I was shocked. But they did come back and replace it and taped a plastic bag over it.
1|I was worried because the price seemed low compared to other hotels in the area, but I took a chance because it looked great. IT WAS! Fun friendly bar, beautiful grounds, good food at restaurant, perfectly heated pool, plenty of parking, convenient location. Had forgotten I'd stayed here before, and the place was great the first time too. Will definitely stay again when I am in the area.,
1|Pro's..... great staff, clean rooms beautifully kept grounds and facilities. Free wi-fi, guest use of computer and printer, cafe on site, free airport shuttle.Con's.....no in-room microwave, thin walls, isolated location.no free breakfastEmployee was late for work so the airport shuttle started a bit late, but that was our only real complaint during our stay.,
1|Staff was friendly and professional. Rooms were nice and clean. Pool and jacuzzi was great. Breakfast was delicious. We enjoyed use of the breackfast room for my husband's 60th birthday .Our kids and grandkids where all very comfortable in the suites. Thanks again!
1|Great price for a 2 room suite with fridge microwave + TV's in each . Sliding doors can seperate second room from bedroom with king bed. Sofa in second room is a hide a bed. Big pool great for kids+ hot tub for adults. Mission Valley Mall just min's away with good choice of restaurants. Staff very helpful. Free breakfasts had great variety was best that we've had. Rooms could use some minor repairs but not VIP. Very pleased with stay.
1|We picked this hotel due to its proximity to Sea World. The room was outdated but large and clean. The only complaint we had was we were on the first floor right by the pool. It was noisy most nights up to 10 p.m.Breakfast was pretty good. Parking was free since we booked with a travel agency. Restaurants and shopping was 5 minutes away.We would stay there again but in a room further from the pool.
1|My wife and I recently spent a night at this property. We had never stayed at a Quality Suites property before. We came away very impressed. For our stay, at the end of May, it seemed the majority of the renovations had been completed. We received a complimentary room upgrade, thanks to Frederick Ross at the Front Desk. He was very helpful and very friendly.Our room was exceptionally clean and well appointed. The bed was firm and comfortable. Huge bathroom. There was a jacuzzi tub and even a gas fireplace.The Internet was fast and easy to hop on. The breakfast in the morning was also very good with a nice variety of hot items. It was easy to get to some very nice restaurants for a good meal as well.All in all we will now include Quality Suites in our list of choices for properties to stay at while traveling. An excellent value and
1|The King suite with 2 double beds is great, although very tight space. The beds are bunkbeds in a separate room with door. Each room has a TV. There is a heated swimming pool with hot tub.The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was at the end of the corridor, so very quiet.The price is very reasonable, but there is a large fee for parking.
1|we had an amazing time at this hotel def coming back for our next family vacation room was nice and cold and clean and for a decent price the staff was also very helpful and polite. Breakfast was good
1|Great Stay-I was provided an upgraded suite room. Very nice. Room suite very spacious. All hotel amenities were readily available. Hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. I will definitively stay here again. I like the close proximity to freeway, shopping center and restaurants. Waffle house restaurant breakfast was fantastic and very delicious.,
1|It was an excellent stayPerfect location for my conference.The person at the front desk rather seriousThe maid service excellent, thanks to the manager of the cleaning staff, very friendly, helpful, and hardworking, kindly helped me with my luggage, to prepare my waffles at breakfast, I saw her there helping too!I will recommend this hotel to my friends and I will visit again,
1|We stayed here on a 9 night vacation in San Diego. We had a tremendous deal that could not be beat for the amenities this hotel provided. Our kids (ages 4 6) loved swimming in the pool just about daily. Although I enjoyed the hot tub, the drains maybe were plugged since a couple nights the water was spilling over with n a couple people in the hot tub. However I did not notify staff-so I am not complaining, it seemed resolved in subsequent nights.We did have an issue we reported to request a new tub drain plug/stopper and never did get one. We requested twice and the second time was two days before we left so when the kids took baths that night we just made do since we weren't going to wait for maintenance during the bedtime hours.All in ill we had and enjoyable trip and this was a tremendous centralized location for all the sites we wanted to see.
1|Spent the first three nights of a family trip here, using it as a base to see Legoland and Seaworld. The hotel itself is fine (we had a room with a bedroom separated by a sliding door for the children, complete with bunk beds), has a good outdoor pool and spa, and a decent free hot breakfast. All in all nothing sensational, but clean, tidy, reasonable value and - assuming you don't miss the turn off from Mission Valley Fwy! - in a convenient location, only 5-10 minutes from Seaworld and maybe half an hour from Legoland.
1|I think it has been said previously if you are expecting a Hilton at this price, you'll be disappointed. Overall this is a very good property to stay at. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms stayed cool when using the air conditioner. We stayed a total of six nights here, five at the beginning of our trip, then checked out and went up to Disney for five days, then back for one night before flying out the next day. We were happy with the kids suite with the bunk beds. The bunk beds were a little squeaky going up and down, and while the child settled down trying to go to sleep, but nothing that kept anyone awake. The top floor was great for that length of stay, didn't have to worry about ceiling noise that way. The first night I didn't leave the fan on the air conditioner and heard the highway noise come through in the morning and thought a window was open. Turns out the door isn't completely sealed and noise comes through so leave the fan on (it kept the room nicer to sleep anyway). If you are a really light sleeper and can't have the fan on, you might not enjoy this place. The breakfast was really, really good. One of the best setups I have seen. Don't doddle getting down there as they are good at keeping everything nicely filled till about 9:10. Since the breakfast ends at 9:30 on weekdays, the doors are closed at 9:30. If you go down there at 9:25, get everything you need before going to sit down because you won't have a chance to refill because it CLOSES AT 9:30 PEOPLE. At least 4 days we were sitting on the patio waiting for out slowpoke eater to finish and people are getting mad at the girls trying to close the doors and clean up the breakfast because THEY weren't finished eating. Get up and get down there in time and don't bh at the girls doing their job.The kids really enjoyed the pool, we only had time to use it twice but they had a good time. I would have liked to use the hot tub but it was not working while we were there. It was a good week for us, the pool wasn't too busy and was quiet by 10:00. Thank you for adding to our great San Diego/Disney trip, we had a great time.
1|I gave them excellent rating mostly because of the people that work there were so helpful. The place is nice and the room was clean. Bed was great and I slept well every night. Quiet too even though right next to freeway. Had a fridge, microwave and coffee maker in the room. There is a Trader Joe's right across the freeway and that helped with meals. I spent the week there while I visited Comic Con and a shuttle was a few steps away from there. Also full breakfast was included. Food was good. I could not eat the cheese omelette but they looked good. Free Wifi.,
1|If you need a pristine trendy hotel, with all the amenities, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for clean, comfortable lodging, and can put up with a few items that are rough around the edges, this may be the place for you. At about 70/night this place was about half to a third of some of the more modern places that are literally next door. Our modest sized room was a true suite with a door between the bedroom and the sitting area. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a big, clean bathroom. Staff were efficient and friendly. The breakfast was all we could ask for, and was generally kept well stocked. The breakfast rooms are large with lots of seating. As noted, there were some rough edges: the ventilation fans in our room were quite noisy the screen on our window was broken and the pool elevator was creaky, with a well outdated inspection report posted. The location in the valley is just off of I-8, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. We were able to get most anywhere we wanted to go to see the sights in 10-15 minutes.
1|This place was a breath of fresh air. After traveling for 6 weeks we needed a hotel that could offer laundry facilities, fridge, coffee making, breakfast etc... it has it all. The reception and housekeeping staff were all very friendly, even had fresh coffee and crisp red apples at reception. Frederick at front desk was happy to recommend local restaurants and attractions. Although the rooms are a bit dated it had a great comfy bed and a separate lounge. The daily breakfast was fabulous. It even had a hot dish to offer each day. I would highly recommend this hotel to any couple wanting a value for money stay. ,
1|My family and I (2 kids 2 adults) stayed at Quality Suites San Diego Sea World Area in early Oct 2018. We stayed in a king size room with a pull out sofa bed. The king bed was very comfy but the pull out sofa wasnt comfy for the kids and wouldnt be able to accommodate an adult. You would be better to get another bedding configuration. The pull out sofa bed was in an offset room/sitting area (with a separate tv) that can be closed with a glass sliding door. The full room is compact so if you have very big bags, they wouldnt be able to be left open all the time as you probably couldnt walk past them. The kids loved the pool, and we could here a little bit of noise from where we were but not much (we were on the 3rd floor in the far corner so it was the quietest area). The breakfast and breakfast area was good. The staff were friendly and the location was central to the zoo and the airport. We used Lyft to go places. You could go across the highway to the mission valley shopping area but we didnt do that. There is a Dennys, petrol station, benihana, Wendys and another food place within several minutes walk (and a Wendys further) on the hotel side of the highway. Overall we had a good stay as it provided everything we needed for our couple of nights.
1|The hotel is nice, the bunk bed room is the best for a family. Our kids were so excited to have their own room and bunk beds. The pool and hottub were fun too. Breakfast is decent too. But what sold me is the customer service! I will go back. I left a very expensive toy realized it after a 10 hour drive home. They were SO HELPFUL, housekeeping, front desk, everyone. I just got it in the mail less than a week after our stay. THANK YOU COMFORT SUITES!,
1|Overall, a great place to stay. Area is east of Hotel Circle with less congestion easier freeway access. Stayed on the ground floor, steps from the pool and breakfast room. The room was a small suite that appeared to have been recently remodeled with 2 flat screen tv's, fridge, microwave, separate living area with a sofa bed, queen bed in the bedroom and a large bathroom. One of the best free hot breakfast buffets we've ever encountered. Huge serving area, separate dining area for approximately 40 people and an additional outside patio seating area. We stayed on a weekend and no lines for breakfast. Be aware that the hotel charges 12 a day for parking (lot is very large). At less than 75 a night on a weekend, this hotel is definitely a keeper!
1|We always have stay at Comfort Inn for the last 8 years. We have stayed at this hotel for the last 5 years when we visit San Diego, CA. We have stayed at other hotel but in the end we choose Comfort inn. They have a Great Staff very good Breakfast and they listen to you. Just other GREAT STAY. Because the hotel will make the different in your time of stay.,
1|Nice comfortable motel. Bed was comfortable, room was clean, breakfast was wonderful. Some noise heard through the walls from other tenants, but not a big problem. Costs we're reasonable and we would stay there again given the chance.
1|I recently visited the area for Spring Break. This location was perfect. Close to all of the major attractions (Petco Park, Sea World, SD Zoo, etc). We were very close to the interstate but the location was very quiet. Shopping centers, movie theater, and numerous restaraunts nearby. We had issues checking in and the room type we booked was not available the first night. We were put in a smaller room but we did get a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Breakfast included hot items but they left a bit to be desired but my kids loved the make your own waffles (get there early or prepare to stand in line for quite a while). The outdoor heated pool/hot tub area was nice and well stocked with towels. The rooms were a bit tight (family suites) but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. There are lots of families that stay here so there was constant noise from children running the corridors so if you are looking for peace and quiet this might not be for you. Overall a nice stay despite a few issues.
1|We had two rooms for one night here, just staying over with some family after a college graduation ceremony. It was Memorial weekend, so understandably full of lots of families with younger children. The rooms were clean I appreciate the sheets covering the blanket and the fitted bottom sheet on the bed. Two areas in the room separated by glass doors. Two TV's, wi-fi, small frig and microwave:) Our internet rate was very reasonable for the area, especially considering it was a suite. They do charge 8 for parking most we have stayed at in the Hotel Circle area don't. The downtown hotels in San Diego almost all charge for parking, and charge a lot more. This is a pretty central location to get to all of San Diego's attractions. The breakfast was fairly standard, but is a good convenience to have to get something to eat in the AM before taking off to do touristy things.,
1|The service was great. I was there for the weekend to get away. This is my second time staying there. I love the spilt rooms. I would reccomend this hotel to all my friends. I live in San Diego and I choose them because of the service and its very quite.
1|good, clean and convenient, price was right,personnel very accommodating--a little hard to find some places due to no signage--would go again--food was very good at breakfast and service excellent. would ck out ref. before if needed..ours wasn't connected and didn't work when connected..but we had a cooler.
1|This hotel is located in the Hotel circle area of San Diego. Please note being a San Diego resident, this hotel is not close to the downtown / gaslamp area or tourist attractions of San Diego. You are a good 15 / 20 minute cab ride to downtown. Most people stay at these hotels to be near the shopping malls. You will need a car to get around out here, the freeways around hotel circle are all over the place.The room itself is clean and big, but a little dated and the old wooden furniture could use a change, but understand that this hotel is more towards the budget end of hotels in San Diego, so its very decent for the price and surround by other hotels with a La Quinta property right next door.The breakfast is your average one with choices of bread, muffins and some scrambled eggs and sausage, coffee, or make yourself a waffle and some yogurts are available.The bed was pretty comfortable and i felt safe in my room and could not hear any noise from the neighbors. It's also nice you have a lounge area in your room to watch tv and relax and be away from the bedroom. The room also has a fridge and a microwave in them.Overall this is a good location if you need to be in Mission valley.
1|We have just finished our trip here and all was perfect for my family (we have two children of 4 and 5 years old). We chose a king suite. The king bed was really comfortable. The room is tiny but there is so much to do in San Diego that we did not have to stay in the room other than to sleep. Perfect breakfast. Perfect pool and hot tub. Clean. The only negative point is that the hotel is not really eco friendly... plastic glass, plastic utensils....Well situated (need a car).,
1|We stayed here for one night with our 2 young kids. As mentioned in other reviews, some of the suites are quite small, although some of that is probably just due to having a divider in the middle of the two parts. It was nice having a divider between us and the kids, even if it was just a clear door. The one suggestion I would make to improve the property would be to have either clouded glass or curtains over the glass part of the doors so that they're not completely transparent. That way you can still watch TV after the kids have gone to bed without worrying about waking them up.While the rooms show some use, the property has been kept up well. The pool was clean and heated and there are some nice areas for eating outside in the perfect San Diego weather. The hotel is about 10 minutes from Sea World, Mission Bay, and downtown,so its a quick jump to everywhere, although the downside is that nowhere is within walking distance. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They were very accommodating when we requested a crib for the room and, after we left one of our phone chargers, they went to our room and called us when they had found it. Service like that is what makes this hotel go from just average to very good.Overall, this hotel is a solid choice, as long as you don't mind driving to the local attractions. Also, just as a tip, there's a parking fee for parking in the lot, however, you can park on the steet for free, as long as you can find a spot.,
1|The staff was the other best thing about this hotel. They were very friendly and efficient, getting our keys replaced (twice), killing the ants eating my birthday cake and clearing the stopped up toilet.This is an older hotel, but the price is reasonable, it was clean and it has a great location near downtown and a mega shopping center. The rooms have some wear, but were roomy with a bedroom and sitting room. There was also free wi-fi, breakfast, computer room, refrigerator, micro and pool. Parking was 12. per night.Nice place if you're not too picky and can keep a sense of humor.
1|Hungry They got you covered evening and breakfast.. comfy bed, quiet. Pool and Hot Tub both nice. The Air worked great and there was an option to leave the fan on all night. Clean and spacious room. Would stay again,
1|Hampton inns are my favorite hotel to stay at no matter where I go. If there is a hampton to choose, that is my pick every time. They are clean and comfortable and they have the BEST beds. Their breakfast is great too. Dressed up oatmeal is my favorite. They took away the to go bowls, but I improvise and...
1|The Hampton in Heritage Square offered us a high quality night's stay. The restaurants surrounding the hotel were plentiful and varied. Beds are always comfortable at a Hampton. I would highly recommend this Hampton.
1|I was out in Indiana for a get together and the Hampton being my go to hotel I stayed at this one. There was an odd smell to the building while I was checking in and it lingered all the way up to the 3rd floor where my room was. Once in my room though I couldn't smell it. The...
1|Two and 1/2 blocks to Union Square, two blocks to San Francisco Shopping Center and BART two blocks to the Cable Car line a good location for shopping and sightseeing. Smallish room--tastefully appointed with touches I've seen in high-end hotels--was cozy and comfortable. It's in the heart of downtown, so we expected to hear city sounds from the room, but we slept well and comfortably in a room overlooking the street. The crowning grace, though, was the excellent and helpful staff. We forgot to make dinner reservations and was out shopping, but a call to the concierge got us an 8pm table on Saturday night in a highly-rated restaurant. The front desk staff was uniformly friendly, interested in helping us enjoy our stay, and full of useful not-in-the-guidebooks information. We'd return to the hotel without hesitation.
1|Location of hotel was walking distance to AT T park, and walking distance to local transportation and shops. Staff was very friendly and helpful, Rooms, were clean and comfortable, ours was a little on the small size but comfortable.,
1|Front desk has an excellent customer service, good price for a downtown hotel which is near to all restaurants and shops. Great staff however room is really small and you can hear next door. No views,
1|Great location! Within steps to shopping and restaurants. We had a problem with our coffee maker but it was quickly replaced. Only negative thing about our stay was the valet rate was pricey but I guess that's the norm for San Francisco.Greetings 763christinap, thank you for giving us a 5 star rating. We are pleased to know that your shopping trip and stay at the Abri was successful. Stay vibrant!,
1|I have stayed at all the big hotels in the Union Square (Westin, Hyatt, Hilton, etc ) and a number of boutique offerings as well. This may be my favorite one. The valueIs by far the best in the area. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and the vibe is casual/chic. Huge thumbs up!
1|A wonderful hotel in a great location. The staff at the hotel go beyond the call of duty to be helpful. The rooms are small but very well equipped. The beds are very comfortable. This hotel is a real gem and I can highly recommend it.
1|The hotel was very clean. The staff are all nice . Situated very near shopping malls restaurants. They have great deals you can avail at an affordable price. We had a spacious room with a king bed and a sofa bed and 2 flat TV sets. There was plenty of space to roam around. Hello MariaLorenaR, thank you giving us a 5 star rating. We are delighted to know that we were able to meet your expectations. Please come and see us again in the near future! Stay vibrant!,
1|We stayed at the Monticello Inn for Labor Day weekend. We were 2 couples each with our own room. Upon arrival we were promptly attended to and checked in quickly. Vallet took our vehicle and we headed up to our room. The street it is located on is (Ellis) runs into Powell which is the main street the Trolleys run up and down. This hotel is located in Union Square, your really are in the middle of a great shopping center! Each side you walk you've got shops Adidas, Puma, Bloomingdale's, etc etc! A+ for Location!Once we entered our room, the only negative thing about this whole expreience was the smell of Freshly baked Subway Bread! Ha ha, I believe because of the way the hotel is built the center subway is one level with it's vents on there roof, there roof is also the first floor of the 5 story or so hotel, so it vents into the shaft of sorts and straight into your a/c unit. Big woop! Seeing as we don't like to hibernate in our room when this city is alive, it didn't bother us one bit, except when you woke up in the morning crazy a sandwhich (he he). We reserved a one Bedroom Suite. Upon entering it we were surprised to see how roomy it was. You first enter a living room with a miniature refrigerator, big enough to fit a 2-liter and some can drinks. The Tv is a good sized tv, everything is clean and neat. The couch is comfy as well as the Chair. They have these gorgeous Bay windows with seats built all around it so you can absorb the light if you so choose, cause there isn't much of a view! The bedroom is completley seperate from the living room, there is a door that divides it ( not too common with suites) The decor is exactly as it appears on the website, the stripes look overbearing at first but they are not I assure you! The bed was very comfterble, the sheets where clean. It was very pleasant. The bathroom had a Shower tub Combo, clean as well, no rust or grime build up. This room was a perfect gathering space for us and our friends, seeing as they had gotten a standard room I did look at it and it was very spacious as well. Enjoy the Pictures and the hotel, it is in an incredible location!,
1|The Abri is a nice boutique hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent. A couple blocks from Market St. I stayed during the Salesforce conference and I was happy to be in a quieter property that was close to all the major venues. The only very minor negative is the rooms were slightly on the smaller side. Or at least the room I had was. But the room was nicely appointed and it was similar to a hotel room you would get in Europe. Room size for me was entirely acceptable and did not make my stay any less comfortable. I would absolutely stay there again as I prefer boutique hotels versus the large chains. It's a nicely run and comfortable property.
1|We came into the city to celebrate our 25th Anniversary and stayed at the Hotel Abri. We both thought it was wonderful! Great location, great room, fantastic service with attention to detail!
1|My husband and I stayed six nights of their deluxe double room. This hotel was super convenient. Turn right within five minutes walk is the cable car and all the famous U.S. department stores, like Bloomingdale and Norstrom which are inside the big Westfield shopping mall, Walgreen, the supermarket is just in the neighbouhood. There is a Chinese restaurant and a Sushi place just cross the road. I love the bed in Hotel Abri, there were four medium size pillows on it and the bed was very comfortable. The room was very small but everything was in it, also the bathroom was very small, too. The air-condiitioning was the old-fashioned window ones, very noisy. It depends on what you are looking for, for location, this should be a good choice, everything is within walking distance and there is no need to rent a car because parking is very expensive in downtown San Francisco, valet parking in this hotel cost you US50 a day!The elevator was a bit scary, recommended to hold 4 persons! I saw some people choose to use the stairs. All the staffs were very friendly. There was free Wifi but it also depends what time, at night it is super-slow. My room was very quiet because I read the comments before booking this hotel, make sure you ask for the interior room and higher floors. There was a funny smell in the hallway but not inside the room. All in all, I think this hotel worth the money and if I want to stay in San Francisco downtown, I would surely book Hotel Abri again.
1|I came in for a wedding and wanted to be in the heart of it all. It is a beautiful place and I shall return. The hotel was pricey for the amount of space and amenities but the I enjoyed everything else. Will return for a longer stay with friends to explore more and do more!
1|We booked this hotel through priceline several years ago and got a fantastic deal - around 70/night. It's small and a bit faded but it had charm and the location is fantastic. It's a lot more fun than paying the same price or more to stay at a motor lodge on Lombard street.
1|From the door service man to the front desk personnel to the maid service, ALL is excellent customer service at this Hotel Abri in San Francisco. All the employees are very kind and friendly, and are willing to do everything to make you happy. I spoke with the manager as well, and he was very kind and willing to talk to us to make sure we had an excellent stay. If I ever get back to San Francisco, I will stay at the Hotel Abri again. It's in a great location 1 block from Union Square.,
1|The location and price of this hotel were exactly what we wanted...1 block from the BART and 2 blocks from Union Square. The hotel is very well managed, clean, and comfortable. Great showers and comfortable beds. We weren't in the hotel much as we were on a vacation and were busy running around but we looked forward to coming home to our hotel each night and finding dinner at all the local restaurants. It's centrally located to everything you'll want to see. We're very frugal people so we vetted many, many hotels. And finally settled on this one. So glad we did! Anytime we go back to San Francisco (which now we want to make a regular thing out of it) we want to stay at Hotel Abri. We even looked into their enrollment program to earn free nights...and we never do that. When we were initially debating whether to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf area or Union Square, we ultimately decided we wanted to be in the city...not a tourist attraction, so we went with Union Square. It was great to visit touristy areas but come back to local life. That said, Union Square is a huge shopping mecca so you could argue that its a commercial area. But the vibe feel much more local. This hotel is like staying Union Square in NY versus sleeping in Time Square...exactly how we wanted to experience San Fran.
1|The hotel is in a good location and the restaurant had excellent food. Rooms are a bit on the small side, but still very comfy and adequate for my needs. It was clean and the staff was very nice and helpful. It's a great hotel for nonsmokers, but would not recommend it for smokers as there are no outdoor facilities and the location makes it nearly impossible to accommodate.
1|Great hotel in the middle of everything San Francisco. I walked to world class dining and shopping. A couple of blocks from Chinatown and around the corner was the cable car, municipal buses, and the BART. I parked my car with the valet and didn't use it again until I checked out.The staff was genuine, friendly, and helpful. Sitting in the lobby with coffee and the morning paper was a joy.I want to know how and why the hotel smells like cookies, except in my room, which smelled fresh and clean.It was fun and restful, a hard combination to achieve.,
1|Stayed as part of our honeymoon trip for 3 nights. Checked about 10pm, wasnt the most friendly of greetings but hey. Had requested a high floor room, would have been nice to be wished a happy honeymoon but never mind. Asked when checking in if we had to pay for a safe or if it was in the room as we had a lot of flight tickets, money, credit cards, passports, iPads etc with it being a long trip, told it was in the room. Got to the room, no safe, rang down and spoke to the guy who checked us in who said oh yeah there is no safe in that room, a bit exhausting after a long flight from NY. Moved rooms which was fine, a bit small so no space for our luggage but a good spacious bathroom and the room was modern and clean. Reception staff quite disappointing, I have worked in hospitality and it wouldnt take much to say:- youve obviously just arrived, do you need help with eating tonight - we had never been to the city and being 10pm at night were unsure of where to go- we dont serve breakfast, do you need some recommendations- (when checking out with 4 suitcases) do you need a taxiNot much of an effort to help make our stay a little easierGood location, nice hotel, few niggles let it down
1|Good location. Excellent staff. The customer service is the reason to stay here. The restaurant doesn't serve breakfast, which was a draw back. But there are several good breakfast places in the area.,
1|The hotel Abri is a hotel that has been renovated very well. The building itself is old but the inside is modern and decorated in a boutique style.I booked this hotel based on the reviews on trip advisor and the location. We were staying in SFR for 3 days so wanted to be close to Union Square, which we were. The hotel room we booked was a suite as we travelled with 2 children. The room was fine, clean, modern. Slightly small, but we were in the room very little so it wasnt a priority for us.The staff at the hotel are friendly and very helpful. Ruben will get anything done for you and always with a smile. It does make the difference to be greeted by name and have happy and helpful hotel staff around you.The hotel has a restaurante and bar attached to it... Open to the public and with a good italian/american menu and an excellent atmosphere.There are 3 things that are worth mentioning I think:1. The hotel only has 5 floors so you will hear plenty of street noise etc.2. The windows are small and the aircon/fan units are noisy. Although we didnt really need them very much.3. There is no breakfast available during the week, but there is room service available from 11am onwards. (there are great breakfast places very close to the hotel - Masons was excellent)
1|For San Francisco prices, the Hotel Abri was excellent....friendly people, clean and nicely appointed rooms with an EXCELLENT location. Lots of entertainment and restaurants in walking distance. I recommend this hotel without reservation.
1|It was amazing to visit San Francisco at Hotel Abri in the fall and enjoy the fantastic room, shopping, convention, restaurants and hospitality, for its price its like finding a treasure The hotel is an excellent one and we have experienced a nice time. Every time we entered the hotel, we were greeted with a homely reception. This was our first Abri experience and we were very impressed with the room, hotel and your staff. Indy Shrestha, hotel Manager was incredible and went above and beyond the customer service level. After long days and nights it was truly a joy to come back to the comfort of the room. Definitely, we will be back again.
1|My mother and I came to San Francisco for vacation and enjoyed our four night stay at the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and we appreciated the welcome bag with water snacks and red wine. The room was small and the bathroom very tiny but the beds were comfortable and everything was clean. Decor of the hotel was nice and the location was perfect, close to lots of shopping, cable car rides and attractions. We did not eat in the restaurant even though they gave us dining vouchers because we did not find the menu appealing
1|A lovely hotel and in a great central location just a few minutes walk from Union Square and close to the Cable Cars. The rooms very clean and the shower you could have fitted at least 4 people in it. We will definatley stay there again next time we visit San Fran.
1|My husband and I stayed 4 nights in an upgraded King size room, with a living room, which was comfortable and perfect! We had a great rate, and the hotel is in the perfect location for the theatre, shopping, cable car, and hopping on the train to get just about anywhere. I can't say enough about the front desk staff, who were so helpful and friendly. They provided great tourist tips, and even went out of their way to find us tickets to a sold out concert. Hotel Albri was absolutely perfect, and if we are back in SF, we will definitely stay there again.
1|Cute suits sneakers outfits on the staff and the front desk! Very cheerful housekeeping folks (I hope they're union /or paid well with good bennies pensions!). Very comfortable beds with heaps of pillows. A good amount of space in the bathroom and bedroom. Location is extremely convenient. They offered a choice between a room on the street and a quiet room. The quiet room was very quiet indeed.Nice quality bath supplies, although they didn't always replace stuff when I used it up. Towels definitely fluffy, and I liked the bathrobes they provided. Only weak spots were TV (few channels, not great reception) and the wireless, although free (a must in any reasonable hotel) it is spotty.,
1|Great little hotel in the center of SF. Very close to stores, public transportation (F line to the Wharf), cable cars. Tiny but nice rooms, friendly staff. Negatives: - outrageous parking price (50/night valet) - no gym (it is really small)
1|Staff was nice and professional. They held our luggage while my fiance and I explored the city. The lady at the front desk recommended Cafe Mason for breakfast and it was delicious. Room was average. Bed was very comfortable like sleeping on a cloud. Our room was facing the night club so it was noisy making it hard to sleep. Other than that, I would recommend staying here.,
1|The hotel was nice and it was in a great location. Our room experienced a little outside noise due to the restaurant below, but the hotel staff was very apologetic. The train station and trolley is right around the corner. They don't give very good written directions if you want them, they tell you where something is and you just hope you don't forget what they said. Overall, very happy with our stay.
1|I am regular visitor to SF and this was my first stay in Hotel Abri, I used to stay in the nearby Marriott. Overall, I am highly satisfied with my stay, would recommend it and will certainly come back again. The hotel is very well positioned in the city, close to the large shopping center and quick access to major city landmarks. The rooms are decent size particularly when you consider you are in the downtown core of San Francisco. I had a king size suite, very comfortable, clean, and a well appointed interior. The suite was located internally, away from the busy street which made it very quiet. The hotel staff was very professional, attentive to my requests, and I would like to to thank Christian, Nabih, front desk personnel and everyone else for making my stay at Hotel Abri very enjoyable experience.
1|Fantastic visit from New Orleans for my wife and I. All staff members were terrific and provided genuine care in each interaction. PP was full of flavor, and lead by a great team. I HIGHLY recommend.,
1|I was so pleased when I saw the location and the facilities, however I never knew whether there was a work out room, or what or where any of the amenities were. The front desk people always seemed like they didn't know whether or not to welcome me. We called the front desk one day because the dvd player wasn't working. They didn't send anyone, so I finally went downstairs after thirty minute's to find someone, and it was the doorman that called the maintenance man for me. He came and helped, but could never fix it, so we thought it was our DVD. We spent the last day of our trip traveling back to where we made the purchase, only to find that it was the hotel's dvd player. So we wasted the entire last day of our trip. So I would say that the service was really lacking, but I loved the building and location and price.
1|Excellent hotel near Union Square. Easy access to other city attractions.Very easy to get almost anywhere in San Francisco from this location. Accommodations are affordable and very comfortable. Highly recommended!
1|Stayed for a long weekend. This place is great. It is steps from the cable car turn around, great shopping, and excellent restaurants!! We had a little suite with a separate sitting room and a pull out couch. We faced inside and it was quiet!! Hotel staff was all so nice and always asking if you needed anything. Quick with extra towels, etc. can't say enough to about this location!!! Full size shampoo/conditioner/shower gel in shower. Great restaurant attached to the hotel. We also revived a little bag upon Checkin with two bottle of voss water, some snacks and a bottle of wine. Everything we needed to get settled! Valet was available for 60 a day (comparable to others in the area) we parked the car and used public transportation the entire weekend. I would have no problems recommended! I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!,
1|Loud street noise wasn't quite drowned out by the droning AC unit. Good thing I sleep like the dead or I would have been dead tired. Maid service was excellent staff very friendly and helpful. Convenient location.
1|Good price and location, noisy for those who look for calm nights, room was too small even for me alone ...but overall I like the place..wifi connection for free which is good, you are right by union square and all shops... you can reach by public transport - no need for taxi
1|What a great stay!!!! This hotel is extremely well located, near Union Square, Bart, Bus stops and major shopping areas. Room was very clean and with a modern decoration. Bathroom very spacious At our arrival, we were upgraded because it was our anniversary and there was even a bottle of wine compliments of the hotel waiting in our room. But service was SUPERB!!!. Front desk staff was more than Helpfull, specially ELLE, she was great, even helped us to get last minute tickets to see Placido Domingo at the Opera. Complimentary coffe at the room and the one offered at the lobby very good! This was my third visit to San Francisco this year, and this hotel was by far the most enjoyable. Now I found our Boutique hotel in SF, definitively coming back again.!!!!
1|From the moment I arrived, I received superior customer service from the person who opened the door to the hotel to the front desk staff and that never changed. I requested a quiet room, so they put me in one that faced a brick wall to another building, but this was far superior to not being able to sleep due to street noise as other reviewers mentioned. The room was nice, clean and quaint. Comfy bed. Free WiFi, which worked well. Free coffee tea. The location was perfect for my needs - I was on business attending a conference two blocks down (Moscone Center area). And, there were some great restaurants nearby too. I'd definitely stay again!
1|You just walk out and experience San Fransisco. Loved the hospitality of the staff.Especially the younger guy (sorry, forgot your name). Very interested in his guests and tries to transpose in situations. If you read this, hope you still love the love the house and techno music :)
1|Excellent location very close to all public transportation with cable car just around the corner, shopping mall just a few minutes walk away and all sorts of restaurants in walking distances from the hotel. Very nice and helpful staff.,
1|The staff alone was cool and accomodating enough to make me want to stay there every time I return. The location was very central to lots of great shopping and restaurants. The room was clean and comfortable. No complaints!
1|I love this hotel and its location. Our room which I requested to be located away from the street was honored with no problems. Jonathan who checked us in was wonderful! In learning we were return visitors and celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary, he graciously upgraded us to a larger room. The room was comfy, cozy and the bed was sooo comfortable, Slept like a baby. EVERY ONE of the hotel staff displayed wonderful hospitality to us during our 4 day stay. My only wish, is a shower with more pressure.You could not ask for a better location or a great staff and rooms. We will be back!!!,
1|From the moment we were greeted by the doorman and the staff at check-in, everyone went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. They provided parking options (60 for on-site valet), presented us with a welcome bag full of treats. They were even able to accommodate an early check-in. The location is fabulous. We chose Hotel Abri because it was over 100 less than a place across the street. I couldn't have been more pleased. I would definitely stay here again.
1|Hotel Abri is a clean, cute, boutique hotel with a great location. I've stayed at over 5+ hotels in the area and this had by far the best staff. They were friendly, attentive, and very helpful when I had questions. Unlike some of the larger hotels in SF, this one makes you feel at home and cared for. In terms of the most impressive of the staff, Kelly Nguyen stuck out and really went above and beyond. Thank you.
1|Convenient location to race finish line. Conveient to major shopping district, trolly station and walking distance to fun sites to see. Rooms were on the small side but to be expected with a historic building. Very nicely renovated. Beds were comfortable and room was quiet had no trouble relaxing and sleeping.,
1|Abri is a very nice and modern hotel in an old building in the Heart of San Francisco. It is very tastefully decorated, clean and fresh. Interior rooms are quiet and will allow you a great nites sleep. Real HD TV, not just a big screen with SD TV. You wont be disappointed.
1|This is a great place to stay in SF downtown - close to everything, very nice hotel, helpful personnel. The room is a bit small but very modern, bathroom is really nice. Overall - great stay and value for money!
1|Just stayed at Hotel Abri this past week end. The staff was amazing. Very friendly, attentive and shows an interest in your whereabouts. We had an Oasis Suite, and pull out queen size bed was comfortable. Bathroom is pretty good size with 2 separate sinks. Location is superb! Walk to China town, North Beach and so close to Bart. My only complaint thus the reason for Very good vs. excellent is the noise level. The suites face the street, and with construction in the area which starts up at 7:00AM, it was LOUD. Construction will go on for a while since they are building a bart station. There is a bar close by and the shouting/talking at night can be deafening. Ask for an inside room to avoid this disturbance. If you must have a suite, then bring ear plugs. Will return for sure!
1|I stayed there last week and it's a nice little hotel. Location is close to Market St, cable car, buses, and plethora of bars and restaurants. My room is like a city apartment and felt very homey as opposed to a hotel. So, that was nice. The staff is very friendly and helpful. One of the staffs, Taylor, gave great recommendations to Thai and other restaurants in the area. Thanks, Taylor!! I will definitely stay at Hotel Abri again.,
1|Abri Hotel is a very good option for staying at San Francisco. Its very well located and staff is really friendly and helfpul. The only thing you need to know is that you are going to pay a lot of city taxes.
1|Very nice boutique hotel in a great location. Rooms facing the courtyard were quiet. Friendly staff and clean rooms. Would definitely recommend. Reasonable price for San Francisco too. Short walk from Union square
1|Used hotel tonight, got in late, was greeted by Kevin who helped me plan a run route. Got to the room it was clean, great bed. Location is prime close to market street. Nice gem, excellent service. Will definitely stay here again.,
1|We have stayed at this hotel for three straight years. We in this case includes myself, my wife, and our 8 kids. The kids have ranged in ages from 1 year old up to 17 years old (depending on the stay) and we have loved it every time.We have stayed in a suite each year and at least one (sometimes two) other rooms. The suite with the adjoining room is great for our needs.The location is perfect. Right near the Bart, right in Union Square. Need a quick bite to eat for a picky kid Subway is next door. Want a quick ice cream for a kid (or adult) quickly Cold Stone right next door, as well. And of course you are within about a 3 minute walk of 100 other restaurants of 35 different types.Why do we keep coming back to the same hotel with all the other choices SERVICE! This place just gets it. They put an emphasis on service that is difficult to find. There may be hotels with more room or for better prices. But knowing that we will be treated exceptionally well and knowing the staff will help us out with any questions or needs is worth the extra few dollars. My only complaint is that the suite has bathroom doors of frosted glass so you can see the silhouette of the person standing in the bathroom or getting out of the shower. Not perfect for a family, and also the door is sliding, no locks. Made more for a couple than a family, so communication is important to avoid any issues. Still, more than worth the minor inconvenience with all this hotel offers.
1|This is a very clean and friendly place to stay. It is a couple of blocks from BART (easy to and from SFO) and one block from the Cable Cars. The area is great for shopping and has easy access to all parts of town.
1|We had a wonderful experience at Hotel Abri. From the moment we arrived, staff were warm, welcoming, professional, and helpful. The hotel is older but the rooms are updated and renovated. The hotel has great incentive programs (Green for Green). We had a few special requests that were easily accommodated. Great value, great location, great staff!! High recommend.
1|Very positive experience. Super convenient location. Clean and quiet room with plenty of space. Hotel staff very helpful. We got some great tips for eating and sightseeing from Louie, the very friendly concierge. Would definitely stay there again.,
1|Thank you for making my trip to San Francisco for a conference enjoyable. The room was so quiet. It was smaller than most hotel rooms I have stayed in but that made it more cozy. I was able to open the window for air. Everything was clean. The hotel staff were always pleasant and greeted me whenever our paths crossed. Thanks for the gifts just because I did not require maid service.
1|We thought the hotel was very clean, and modern. Ideal position for sight seeing. Very helpful front desk. Great restaurant next door. Great happy hour. Would definitely go there again. Easy to get on public transport, trams, buses etc. Great restaurants at Fishermans Wharf. Must go to Alcatraz, very interesting.,
1|We chose Hotel Abri from among many choices in the neighborhood and price range mainly because of the interesting look of the decor in the photos. Glad we did! The staff were all extremely nice, and the room was quite comfortable. This was only an overnight trip, but we look forward to coming back and spending more nights here.
1|My sweety and I had visited San Francisco for an overnight trip and decided since I found a shockingly great price for this hotel and knew the neighbourhood, I figured this had to be good.. Understatement! The Hotel Abri was a stellar hotel staff is always glad to see you, hotel is kept in immaculate condition, bed was worthy of taking home if it were possible, and L'Occitane toiletries were teh OMGz.. Ginormous flat-screen TV also came with a connection for your laptop so you can use it as a monitor, clock radio also had an iPod dock attached. The only negative out of the entire stay (which the Abri can't really help) was facing another hotel I've visited previously which had a new club open up. And when you have late night clubs in a big city, you also get an occasional drunk being asked to leave said club for acting royally ASBO. Other than that, I'd recommend the Abri if you're looking to splurge a bit for a hotel not far from Powell Market, a major transit hub and terminus for the Cable Cars just a couple blocks away..
1|Okay experience but disappointed that I had a room next to constant construction. Also disappointed in the fact that I thought I was getting l'occitane products as well. Room was good and bed was comfortable.
1|I stayed here recently for a conference. It is centrally located, short walk to Moscone (which is undergoing reconstruction), and very comfortable. I was greeted with a gift bag (usually this is only for weddings) that contained a small bottle of wine, 2 bottles of water, and snacks, which I appreciated. They also provided a 10 credit for the restaurant. The room was small, but there was room for my suitcase, I could hang my clothes in the closet, I could work at the desk, everything was clean, and the room was quiet. What else do you want when staying downtown in San Francisco
1|This was our first stay in the Hotel Abri and we were impressed with the hotel and the staff. We had a Queen size Junior Suite for less than the price of a tiny room in one of the other more well-known hotels. Location is great - 1 block from Powell Street cable car and 2 blocks from Union Square.
1|Hotel Abri is a wonderfully located hotel near Union Square and all the amenities you'll need in San Francisco. The staff are friendly, the rooms are clean, the amenities are good and the price is competitive. Recommended.
1|Enjoyed staying here. The staff was great (very attentive helpful) the rooms were clean. The rooms were small though. I enjoyed eating at the on-site restaurant. The food bar services were great!
1|I stayed here for a few days in a double bed room.Pros:- room clean- mattress and pillows very comfortable- free wi-fi - location very good: downtown, 3 minutes from the cable car terminus on Powell Street- staff friendly and professional.Cons:- given the location, it's a bit noisy at night. Well, downtown San Francisco is a bit noisy, so I guess you'll have the same issues in any hotel there- one of the two elevators was broken, so there was only one, slow elevator serving the whole hotel. You could wait 10 minutes before getting it, so more than once I decided to take the stairs. However, this should be a temporary issue, since I saw they were working on it- the wi-fi was nearly useless--not only communicating via Skipe was impossibile (which might be understandable, given the bandwidth frequired), but also surfing the Web was a hard thing to do at times. This is really an issue they should solve, since it can be done easily and quickly- they don't serve breakfast. There's a restaurant (Puccini Pinetti) which is accessible straight from the hotel, however it opens at 11am, so you can only get a brunch. Anyway, no big issue: there is plenty of places around there where you can have breakfast.Price: I found a discount, so I think the price was fair, otherwise I would say it's a bit costy.,
1|Central to everything. Rooms are a bit on the small side, but they have all you need. We stayed three nights. Its a nice, comfortable and clean hotel. Shopping is very close by and its about a 10 minute ride to Fishermans Wharf and the other touristy stuff.
1|Good to stay confortable. The location is the best. Rooms are small than expectation but its not the worst.all are staffs very kindly and helpful.wifi is available and there are nothing the problems during stayed.
1|I and my wife stayed in the Hotel Abri 2 nights, the room was not huge but very clean decor 4 star hotel. The staff was very helpful and the location fantastic Hotel in downtown San Francisco. Next year we plan to go back to San Francisco and Abri will be our Hotel.,
1|Had a suite, which was roomy and well-equipped. Location was fantastic. Staff were helpful. Street noise was the only concern but turning on the fans in the AC units drowned it out. There was no hotel bar or restaurant but there are many nearby.,
1|This was my first stay at this hotel and with the Larkspur brand of hotels. I have been to San Fran a countless number of times and have always stayed in Union Square at other hotels (Hotel Nikko, Kimpton, etc). I must say that this hotel was very nice. It wasnt a large hotel (4 floors) but it was perfect and allowed for a better guest experience in my opinion. The rooms were nicely appointed and extremely clean, very modern. They are on the tight side but that is normal for SF, so no big deal. The staff at this hotel were probably some of the best I have encountered in a while. They were genuinely nice and allowed us to check in 4 hrs early. They were also quick to ask us if we needed help finding restaurants etc. Location is great, 1 block from the BART station, great if you are arriving from SFO, or OAK. Cable car is also right down the street. Area was safe at all hours of the day, except for occasional panhandler but that is normal in every big city.Suggestions for guests would be to ask for an interior courtyard room as the exterior rooms face a nightclub and it can be noisy. If not ear plugs are readily available at the front desk.Overall this hotel is tops and I would stay here again if I am back in the city.
1|We were charged for the first night of stay even though we were not in SF yet due to a sudden death in the family. In addition, the room we were given the next day was one of the smallest I've ever had, even though we had requested ahead of time to an upgrade. Told we didn't get the upgrade because we weren't there to check in. Throughout our four-night stay, one elevator was out of service and the other was very slow. We resorted to using the stairs to our third floor room. At checkout, we waited almost 15 minutes for an elevator because our luggage was too heavy to carry down the stairs. HOWEVER, for our final three nights we were upgraded to an Oasis Suite for no additional charge (beyond the night we were charged and didn't use). Very quiet, spacious room facing courtyard. Location is great for all SF tourist activities and shopping. Ate one night in the Italian restaurant. It was decent and the service was good. If check-in and the first night had been better, I'd give it a 5, but the poor first impression dropped the overall score. Hope both elevators are now functioning!
1|My husband, 4 year old, and I stayed at the Hotel Abri from Oct 11-14, 2012. The staff at this hotel were beyond 5 star with their service. They were helpful, honest, and really went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. My daughter was taken with Tyler at the front, in particular! Aside from the service, the boutique hotel was fine. We had an urban suite, which had ample room. The two window units kept the place cool, and the curtains kept out enough light. My only complaint, and I mean ONLY complaint, was that the bathroom door was a sliding door, did not lock, and was frosted glass. If you have kids, you know that sometimes your only solitude can come from the few moments you get in the bathroom. My daughter had a grand time putting her face up to the glass and letting us know she was well aware we were in there, and I am thankful she never realized she could actually open the door. My husband would probably say that he didn't care for the fact that sometimes during the day you could smell Subway from downstairs in our room (on the 2nd floor), but we weren't in there much, and it was minor. The hotel was very convenient to the cable car that took you to the Wharf, as well as the BART and other public transport. There was AMPLE shopping in the area too. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel, mainly to people traveling without small kids. LOL,
1|Stayed here during a conference being held at the mega hotel Hilton up the block from Abri. Glad I chose the Abri, medium sized, clean hotel in a Union Square central location. My room was small but perfectly formed and the walk-in shower was powerful. My room had a strange smell to it during my stay which meant I had to have the window open most of the time for fresh air. Ask for an inner room to avoid noise from the busy street outside.I visited SF about 5 years ago so was shocked at the amount of homeless people everywhere this time round. Every street corner was filled with people begging so be prepared to have your dollar bills ready. Breakfast downstairs in the restaurant was good. Great shopping near by. Enjoy!
1|We stayed 2 nights and could not have been more happy with the hotel. The hotel is situated in a great position close to all the major stores and good restaurants. The staff at the front desk went out of their way to assist us. Would highly recommend a stay.
1|Great location hip and trendy interior nicely appointed rooms. FREE internet access in your room! Really appreciate the fact that they recognize those serving in our military with special deals! We requested a room away from the elevators and stairs and our request was met 100!
1|The location of the hotel is excellent, right by Union Square and Westfield Shopping centre on Market street. The staff are excellent and have great attention to detail. Rooms are great and given its location are very quiet, perfect for a good nights sleep. Only one minor niggle which is that the showers are really not very powerful at all.
1|Happy to be in SF for the first time in this Hotel. Our room was well furnished and we took a mini-suite for our 3 family member. We would definitely come back here the next time. Our slight disappointement was related to the ameties: difficult to find some coffee during the day.
1|What a great hotel. We arrived early after about 22 hours travel and they had a room ready for us straight away along with a lovely welcome pack. Location in fabulous and staff are really helpful. Their 10 daily restaurant voucher and Green for Green initiative for skipping housekeeping are excellent. A lovely plac3 to stay.
1|The hotelt is close to the main places: cable car, subway, shops: you can go by walk everywhere. The personnel is nice and friendly, the room is clean, comfortable and nice.If you have some problem to sleep, you have only to ask to have a room not in the front of the street because during the weekend there is a local where the people go to dance we were so tired that we didn't have any problem about it.
1|In a city not known for sumptuous hotels, the St Regis is the local maximum. We stayed in a large, well-appointed suite with a nice view. We were somewhat disappointed by the fact that rooms are on the lower half of the bldg, as the upper half is reserved for residents. The result is that the W just down the street, while not of the same caliber, has infinitely better views. So, ask for floors 14-20. Below that, it s just too low.Second point of criticism - and this applies to all St Regis butlers: they creep us out! These guys need to be less awkward / better trained / older than 15. Now, for the good stuff: Nice pool area, very good spa treatments, and a rather hopping and pleasant lobby bar. The Japanese restaurant was also rather on the nice side. The location is obviously fantastic, with SF Moma half a block away, and all the shops a couple of blocks away.Overall, a relaxing St Regis - not their best hotel, but definitely the best in San Francisco.,
1|When travelling for business, the thing you care most about is getting some sleep, being able to effectively work and having a functional room that takes all the friction and noise out of your day. The St Regis delivered in spades. Nothing too much trouble for the staff and excellent service on every interaction.
1|We had a long layover in San Francisco and chose to stay in Union Square. The St Regis met our needs in terms of a comfortable place to stay, from which to explore some of the touristy areas of SF. However, traffic getting into the hotel was a nightmare, partly due to Pride weekend when we were there, but in general it did take a long time to battle our way to the entrance every time we took the car out. Service was great at check-in, but when we asked for a kettle for the room and tea, it took about half an hour to arrive, with no tea bags. We don't generally enjoy the butler concept- when we asked for coffee, which was not available in the room like in other hotels, the butler charged us USD18. There was limited food options- a lobby restaurant/ bar and a second restaurant in the back. Food was extremely pricey. The pool was not something my kids wanted to use- a simple lap pool for adults. We are asked for the kids names and told the housekeeping would deliver something for them, but it didn't materialize, much to their disappointment. It is definitely geared toward the business traveler.,
1|Got a nice room (1715) on 17th floor, but woke up three times at night because somebody must have run the tap or had a shower. When having a shower in the beautful seperate shower cabin, twice I adjusted the water temperature, stood under the shower for a minute or so when the water got really scorchingly hot and I had to move away from it, turn down the temperature, almost turning the water off, wait a minute for it to cool down, then feel it got really cold. Back to the original setting and eventually enjoy the shower.Sorry guys, at 490 a night that's not okay. Noise plus burning yourself is not acceptable.One more thing I hate: Monday night 7.30, I want to go jogging and ask for steam room/sauna after jog. Answer: it's part of our Spa and admission is 20 for hotel guests - and it closes at 8pm on a Monday. Come on, guys, that's not okay for a 5 Star hotel. Not only having to pay - but closung at 8 doesn't work for business people!,
1|Of the ten or so hotels I've stayed in in San Fran, the St. Regis is my favorite. Great location, lovely lobby and bar, and sleek modern rooms. Restaurants always left something to be desired, but looks as though a new one just opened. The service is top notch and the concierge is stellar. Sadly, like everything else in SF, the rates have gone up significantly so I don't get to stay there as often.
1|The St. Regis is located pretty conveniently if you have business in downtown SF. The rooms are very new and well appointed. Staff is generally helpful, but service could be better. For example, when I called the front desk to ask about internet access, they informed me it would be extra, even though I could have sworn it was included in my rate (it was). A key issue is there is absolutely zero cellular reception if you're on ATT. The hotel acknowledges this (obviously not their fault), so if you need blackberry access, forget about it.
1|St. Regis are consistently luxurious and expensive. This one is no exception. Small lobby, but great service, beautiful rooms, great workout facility. It is a location that's not overly ideal for the touristy options (Wharf, bridge, china town), but if you want class and can afford it, this is the place.,
1|I've stayed here three times! All of which have been splendid and memorable! The staff make you feel like your coming home! There are a lot of choices when it comes to hotels in San Francisco, make it easy on yourself and pick the St. Regis!,
1|My husband and I stayed at the St. Regis for six nights while visiting San Francisco. I spent a great deal of time selecting the hotel for this trip. After researching and considering many hotels, I chose the St. Regis. I was very happy with my choice. The location was great - it was close enough to every place we wanted to visit, without being in the middle of too much of the touristy crowd. Although our room didn't have the floor to ceiling windows I was expecting, it was nicely equipped and well maintained. I can overlook my disappointment over the absence of a panoramic view because of the amazing service. From the time we made our reservations to the time we left the hotel, the service was attentive and thoughtful, without being obtrusive. The concierge and guest relations people helped us with our wine tour, ferry and restaurant plans. The people at the front desk and in the lobby greeted us by name. Those at the restaurant, the Vitrine, were particularly kind and thoughtful. Kane was our server on most mornings. When he found out it was my birthday, he brought me a special breakfast dessert. To celebrate our anniversary, he brought us champagne and chocolate. The service made it truly a memorable stay. I'm sure that the service at the St. Regis will become the standard by which we will measure other hotels.
1|Well ion advance of our trip out west Mariah at the concierge desk set us up for the best trip possible. She'd helped us some years ago and when I emailed I wasn't sure she'd still be there. Not only did she respond but she also remembered us and was more than helpful and available both in advance of the trip and during. Also Selena and Alexandre (who remembered us from his time at the St Regis NY) were of great help!Also Tatianna and Abhishek with the butler department, Eric at the bar, Irma a the front desk, Freddo at the front door and Linh at the Spa. You will love the place and love the people.
1|First let me start by saying that this is not a cheap hotel, however the same can be said for the majority of downtown San Francisco Hotels. My room was very comfortable and sported an IPad type control screen that enabled me to adjust all the settings in the room such as lights and curtains ect. Service was outstanding and so overall a great experience.,
1|Just complete a stay at St. Regis for our anniversary. Reached out to the hotel in advance and they took great care of us. Had a room on the 16th floor with spectacular city views. Check in was efficient and friendly. Room was large and well appointed - very luxurious. My wife enjoyed the soaker tub. Hotel provided a special amenity in celebration of our anniversary - we very much appreciated the special attention. Used the pool area which had lots of sun and city views. St. Regis beats Ritz and Four Seasons hands down in SF. Thanks for a great stay.
1|All staff was great! Room was beautiful. View from our room was gorgeous. Concierge planned our travel around San Francisco and it was the best. Everyone made our stay very nice. We will return here in the future!
1|The service and staff here were wonderful. The room was very clean and modern. Loved the bathroom and the amenities. Everything you would expect from a St Regis hotel. Walking distance to Union Square and other landmarks with ease.
1|The St. Regis San Fran is outstanding! Location is perfect, just South of Market, right next to the Museum of Modern Art, across the street from Yerba Buena, Metreon, and a short walk to all of the Union Square and Market Street shopping. The hotel is modern and sophisticated, but also really comfortable and welcoming. We loved the fireplace that greets you on the other side of the front door, and the lobby bar is super chic with a lively scene. We loved the indoor pool! This is a great amenity for a city hotel, especially when traveling with a family. The pool is warm and there are tons of windows and natural light. There's a poolside menu for food and beverages. Grill is the contemporary restaurant that serves seasonal dishes with locally sourced ingredients. We are gluten free and they do a fantastic job with this - lots of gluten free menu options and the gluten free bread was delicious. We saw the beautiful house car (a Bentley), but our timing was off with it pulling away each time we were hoping to catch a ride (next time!). We were in a Grand Deluxe Guest room on the 20th floor, and it was amazing. Beautifully finished with high ceilings, big windows allowing for lots of natural light, plenty of space, huge shower, soaking tub, and amazing views over Yerba Buena. My son said the roll away was one of the best he has ever slept in. Can't wait to return to this hotel.
1|A great place to stay in downtown San Francisco. Across the street from Yerba Buena Gardens and walking distance to Union Square and lots of shopping.The rooms are spacious and luxurious, as you would expect. Service is friendly. The hotel restaurant, Vittrine, is also excellent.Enjoyed the free wi-fi too, which other travelers commented on being charged for... so perhaps this has improved/changed.,
1|The platinum spg member upgraded room was nice. They have very good service and the employees did a great job. The hotel is in a nice location for a convention. The room was loud with street noise, guess just part of the deal in San Francisco.,
1|This review is long overdue.This hotel hasn't let me down, (resort I should say)I'm a picky guy when I spend 400+ a night on a room. I want to be treated well, I want staff to acknowledge my presence, and I want them to be courteous and kind and helpful and most importantly quick.In a consumers' world, we have to pay attention to detail. Otherwise the providers will become lazy..At the St. Regis, attention to detail is not a problem. To say the least, they go overboard.All the rooms are cleaned to perfection before arrival, I've stayed here a total of 6 times and have never found something from the room beforeRoom service is of 4-5 Star quality food, hot and ready and fresh.Do not tip the room service, the gratuity is already factored in. Unless you feel like splurging.Amazingly well done eentree choices ordered directly to your room..The reason I go to hotels, is to escape life, go to the spa, sit in my room, watch movies, and be waited on.This hotel does it all.For a Price.a 3 day ultimate vacation as I like to call it, room service once a day, and the spa once a day,Can easily run you over 2000-3000 Dollars here.If you want to just enjoy the room and resort, you can get away with spending 900-1200 on a room for 3 nights and just enjoying yourself.My first stay here was with a Mercedes Benz Voucher way back in the day.Thanks Mercedes Benz, you introduced me to a fantastic resort!
1|Stayed in January for 5 nights. Close enough to the Moscone center (5 minute walk) Staff were very nice and remembered our names, (somewhat) Very nice rooms and comfortable beds. They would clean your room after you left and turn down the beds right before you got back. Unfortunately sometimes the timing was a little off and they walked in while I was changing once and came in while we were there a few other times. It didnt bother me a whole lot but just be aware that if you don't want them to come in then put out the 'do not disturb' sign. Mandatory valet parking and sometimes we were waiting for that service. overpriced hotel bar, you might almost laugh at the prices unless you are made of money (I am not) but then again with how much it costs to stay there a night you probably wouldn't even wink. my view was of a construction sight but I wasn't in the room much so no matter. Never went to the restaurant. there is a pool on the 5th or something like that floor but we didn't swim. Would definitely reccomend if you are rich. If you aren't then dont go broke for the amazing service they offer.
1|The location is convenient, just a few minutes walk South of Market Union Sq.The facilities rooms are very nice.The staff are excellent, as is the service.The barmen drinks are also very good.The only reason I didn't award Excellent is that the food in the restaurant at breakfast lunch was average.Also beware that certain rooms are subject to a lot of street noise.
1|Checking in on New Year's Eve and there was an abundance of staff and champagne cocktails to speed our check in and get our celebration started right away. We had a wonderful room with a private butler and an amazing view of the fireworks over the San Francisco skyline.
1|Stayed at the St. Regis while on business. The rooms were huge! Room had a spacious shower as well as a bath. Wish I had more time to spend in the hotel proper and take advantage of all the amenities. Free shoe shine ... a plus.Highlight: I needed to rent a car, and the hotel's concierge took care of me in 10 minutes ... awesome!,
1|We stopped in for breakfast before our cruise.Very nice hotel and restaurant, great service, food was great!The reason for four stars... My cream pitcher had mold in it.They replaced it and apologized and also removed the charge from our bill. I was not too concerned as mold is not life threatening lol.
1|The St. Regis never disappoints, we stayed in a lovely room with a view of the new Salesforce tower. The light and bright room was welcoming and well appointed as expected. All of the staff we interacted with were friendly and focused on serving our needs with a smile. The St. Regis beds are amazing, I am shopping their site to buy a St. Regis mattress for our home so I can sleep this well at home soon. This is a delightful place to stay in the San Fran.
1|My wife and I took a long weekend trip to San Francisco to celebrate our 10th anniversary. By random chance it was Fleet Week so everything was full and busy. Even with the crowds and a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in the building, the staff made us feel welcome and special. The breakfast at the restaurant on the 4th() floor was impeccable as well.,
1|We had our second stay at the St Regis San Francisco for our annual December SF dining weekend--our first was in 2014, though I've had a few business stays in the meantime. Overall, we still love this hotel--but we did experience a few hiccups with service that gave us pause. The hotel has already provided us with a complimentary stay for 2016 to make up for the problems this year, so we feel the hotel got the message and definitely has taken steps to make it up to us.We were informed of our upgrade from the Astor to Metropolitan Suite in an email from my Ambassador the night before arrival. Yet on arrival, they didn't have us in the Metropolitan Suite. After 25 min and showing the email confirmation, we finally were given the keys to the correct suite. This was a big hiccup, but since we got the upgrade I was willing to let it go.The suite and design of the hotel and and everything about it is still near-perfect for me. I love the design of the property, and the layout of the suites/rooms. I love its location in SoMa. I love the food/beverage, from the restaurant, room service and the lobby bar. Everyone is very friendly.We did have several housekeeping mistakes, and the management response to those was less than satisfactory. Even after our complaints, housekeeping still managed to screw up, something that I'd not experienced on any previous stay at this hotel. The fact that this was the weekend immediately prior to the Christmas holiday made me wonder if the property might be a bit understaffed or under-managed. We also had issues with wifi, both in the room (which was fixed in a few hours) and in the restaurant (which was fixed in about 20 min). We finally had issues with trying to reach our butler(s) on several occasions. We would call and it would ring and ring and ring with no answer on numerous tries. That was also another first for us at this hotel. We often had to call another department to be connected to the butler or front desk, and even then it took more time than it should have. That again made us wonder if the hotel was understaffed due to the imminent holiday period.Otherwise, again, we still love this hotel. Considering that we've had nothing but near-flawless visits here, we were and are most willing to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. The fact that the hotel management awarded us a free 3 night stay for next December 2016 to remedy the mistakes of this visit more than made up for us for the lack of excellent service in the instances described above. We have faith that these were unusual slip-ups, and I still look forward to returning. I also have several business trips to SF planned in 2016, and I expect to be staying here for those, as well.,
1|The St. Regis San Fran is a beautiful high-rise property in a great location in one of my favorite cities. The staff was highly-attentive, but never intrusive. The room service was phenommenal and always hot, delicious, and on-time. The beds and high tech window controls were wonderful too. I didn't get a chance to eat at Ame, but I heard wonderful things about the restaurant in the hotel. The bar area was always popular for cocktails and the gym was fantastic. I would highly recommned making reservations at Gary Danko for dinner, one of the best meals I've ever had! Also Boulevard and Postrio were fantastic and R G Lounge has amazing, authentic chinesse food. I also loved Taylor's Refresher along the Embarcadero for fun and delicious diner style food in an open, casual atmosphere.Overall, the St. Regis is the place to stay if you are looking for one of the best hotels in San Fran with luxury, privacy, and amazing service.
1|I'm a gold Starwood member and membership definitely has its perks. One place where you can definitely take advantage of great opportunities is the St. Regis in San Francisco. I've never had a less than stellar experience here. Stay in an Executive Premier guest room. Terrific value, space, design and comfort. Opt for the butler service -- always spot on and an amazing asset during your stay, from wake up service to the little touches, they anticipate your needs - the butler service is one of the hallmarks of the St. Regis experience. Gin and tonic Why yes, please.I stay at the St. Regis when I have friends in from out of town or when I just need a few days of aaaahhh time or when I'm returning from a long haul flight. I'm never disappointed. Ever. If you have the chance and the budget, do yourself a favor and stay at this truly world-class hotel.
1|The staff were great. Christian at the front desk was terrific and truly offered a luxury experience. Housekeeping staff did a great job and were nice enough to run my wife's bath prior to returning to the hotel (several times, sorry). Private dining breakfast was not the best but again the attendant was very accommodating. We didn't have a chance to experience the spa and pool. Only negative feedback would be that the windows were not soundproof. Overall a very pleasant stay and would return.,
1|It's unfortunate that I only stayed one night because this is a wonderful hotel. The room was so tranquil with neutral colors and simple yet elegant and comfortable furnishings. The bathroom is well appointed with a large vanity area and a deep soaking tub which fills quickly. It is open to the bedroom but with a panel that can be closed for privacy. The bed is so comfortable with the softest sheets. The staff is friendly and helpful. Having checked in somewhat late and being a Starwood member (which was acknowledged at check-in) a request for a (brief) late checkout was honored without any problem. I have found that in general bring polite and reasonable helps a great deal with requests like these. My rate included breakfast which was fresh and plentiful. The service at Vitrine was friendly and quick. I was not there long enough to try the spa, pool or fitness facilities but the look great and I hope to go back for a longer stay and try them. My only complaint about the hotel is the cost to park. The valets are quick and friendly but that doesn't entirely justify over 50 to park for overnight. Also, and this is just a general gripe, I encountered a few spoiled and rude fellow guests who seemed to think that paying a premium for a hotel room entitles them to slam doors and be generally disruptive in public areas. It's just a general wish that people would be polite and act appropriately. I won't blather on about staying on some of the world's best hotels, blah, blah, blah. However the St. Regis San Francisco in my opinion ranks with those in terms of location, service, amenities and comfort.
1|What can I say it is the St Regis. This is a newer building and everything is done with taste and thought. From driving up to walking into check in, to your room. Decor: Very contemporary, but comfortable. Unlike the W which goes for modern mostly the St. Regis San Francisco keeps it clean and contemporary yet tasteful and comfortable. Great earth tone colors and tasteful art through out the building. Food: They have a lobby lounge which is great for just hanging out, having a meeting, or wanting to have a little snack. Nice atmosphere not too quiet, not too loud. They have Art of Tea which is served daily between 2-4pm and reservation are recommended, and finally their restaurant the Grill which is a contemporary dining. Beautiful dishes, great tastes and really if you just want a nice dinner without leaving the hotel you really can't go wrong, but again you are in San Francisco.. Rooms: Well the rooms as I said are amazing. Very clean, very contemporary but comfortable. huge windows allow you to see amazing views of the city and parks. Everything is automated, the bathrooms are large and comfortable. If you like the finer things in life, or want to take your partner on a romantic night this is it. Staff: Again A+ the entire experience was amazing including their staff. The butler service was on point and I really have zero complaints.. A+,
1|Spent two days here prior to a conference that was being held at nearby Moscone Center.Took BART from Airport to this hotel - very easy and fast. Hotel is about 5 minute walk from the Montgomery Street station. Arrived at Noon - room was not yet ready. Front Desk attendant took my phone number and said they would call when room become available - but they never called. Not a big problem - I went out and enjoyed the sights. Came back around 3:30 and was then able to check-into my room. Was given a north-facing room on the top floor (top floor of hotel, that is - the upper floors of the building are for the St. Regis Residences). Room decor was very serene and calming. Never heard anything from outside or other quests while I was here! Bathroom was especially nice, with lots of room, wonderful amenities, rainforest shower and separate soaking tub. Everything in the room seemed fine, except for my master-control panel - some of the features just wouldn't work (phone, radio control, etc.) - I never called for assistance, just got by with using the other phone (think there were four phones total in the room). Bed and linens were OMG spectacular. Slept like a baby and felt wonderful when I woke up!Took any early morning swim in the pool - very nice - and it was great that the pool is open 24/7. Fitness center was well-equipped, and super clean.Ate Breakfast at the hotel restaurant - which was lovely, but quite expensive. Lobby bar and main restaurant looked lovely, but I didn't have a chance to experience them. Visited the Museum of African Diaspora which is accessible from first floor of the hotel - very nice place. The hotel has a great location for visiting the fine arts museums - many within a block or two - Yerba Beuna Gardens, Jewish Heritage, Museum of Modern Art. Also just a couple blocks from the high-end shopping of Union Square.If you are seeking a space of serene luxury in the heart of the SF hustle and bustle, the St Regis definitely delivers.,
1|My husband and I just returned from yet another wonderful stay at the St Regis San Francisco. Three nights again in a beautiful and spacious Metropolitan Suite with proper blackout shades installed in 2016 per my request. Air con was great as always. Had our dog with us again, too.Service and food/beverage again were fabulous. Spectacular Platinum recognition, as always, due both to my Ambassador level status and the fact that I stay here many times every year. (I'll be back again in late August.)The only misses were:(1) Concierge had sloppy mistakes confusing our party sizes for bookings at 2* Commis and 3* Saison. Created a bit of confusion and a little exasperation when arriving at Saison and booking was under wrong name. Settled but stupid.(2) Twice had calls to butler ring way too long before anyone picked up. Pet peeve of mine.(3) Room service didnt have pork sandwich as per menu for a lunch order, then brought my chicken sandwich ordered without avocado...but with avocado--and not toasted fully. Stupid and not impressive. Replaced quickly and whole lunch order was compd.Obviously, the service recovery was wonderful in each instance. But those are mistakes that this hotel doesn't usually make.Still, we had a truly fabulous stay with amazing service otherwise. Everyone knows us by name. Butler service was fab. Packing and unpacking were great. Pressing and shoe shine were done with aplomb. Great service at the amazing bar, at the restaurant for breakfast, from the front desk, valets, everyone.This still is my favorite hotel by far in SF. And it now ties with the StR NY as my 2 favorites in the whole of the USA.
1|This hotel by far is the best hotel to stay for couple or business trip. It's super clean and nice. The staffs are extremely helpful and friendly. I definitely will stay here again for future business trips!
1|Have spent five nights in this nice hotel perfectly located , only couple of minutes from Union Square.We had two connecting rooms accomodating five of us, both perfectly decorated , very spacious and well maintained. Staff is extremly friendly and willing to help. With my youngest daughter have also used pool which is quite largem, clean and not crowded. Only complaint is cost of in room wi-fi access (this kind of hotel should have it complimentary) as well as breakfast arrangements - although waitress are helpfull and polite - 20 minutes to get eggs and croissiants is not acceptable (and also quote expensive),
1|Recently stayed at the St. Regis at the beginning of July. Our stay at the hotel was amazing and it was made even better by the friendly staff. The concierge, Eric, was extremely helpful in recommendations of where to eat and also what wineries to visit. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco.
1|Very smartly located next to the Metreon and the conference center as well as the MOMA. If you are in town for a conference this is for you!If you are a tourist then this is not your best bet as this hotel sits two blocks South of Market St.Suites are very large and boast a dining room, a TV area with a large sofa, a separate bedroom and an expansive bathroom (separate toilets). Amenities are from Remde so top of the line. You will find those products in their Remde spa as well (located on the 6th floor).Gym + indoor pool.Metropolitan suites come with a 24/24 private butler service but expect a VERY slow service. If you order a bottle of champagne to treat your big clients in your suite expect to wait at least 30 min.No coffee maker, no tea kettle, nothing that you can make yourself. Each and every cup of coffee/tea must be ordered through the butler service and expect another long wait.No extra comforter, pillows.Summary: nice and large suites but service can definitely be improved.
1|What a wonderful hotel!!! 5 nights in a room with a great view over the Gardens with hills and sunset in the background. Service is over the top. I think St. Regis has figured out how to know what I want before I do. The food in the restaurants was very good. Concierge staff knew their stuff - great recommendations for places to walk, restaurants, etc. Surrounded by nice museums. We had a great stay
1|My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights because of the close proximity to Moscone Center, the art museum and great shopping, and of course because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. (How did we ever travel before Trip Advisor) Loved our time here. We requested and were given a quiet room - on the 17th floor. Everything about the St. Regis is stylish and modern (though not as great as the St. Regis in Manhattan). I loved the TV in the bathroom. Minor annoyances - the tv remote didn't work - probably dead batteries there was no price list for the overpriced wine in the wet bar - it took 20 minutes to have one sent up the electronic control center on the nightstand acted up a few times, turning the lights on in the middle of the night and I find it annoying to be charged extra for the wi-fi use (15/day). Regarding a couple comments posted earlier about the hallway carpeting, I loved it - a really fun design element. (will post a photo of it) We had the best meal of our stay in the hotel restaurant. The lap pool was warm and beautiful and empty - unfortunately I forgot my suit. Too bad the spa didn't have a basic suit to sell, like they do in some hotels. I would happily stay here again. By the way, San Francisco,what's up with the homeless people on your streets I've never seen so much panhandling and yelling and screaming and craziness and was actually afraid in some situations.,
1|As with any St. Regis, the level of service here is incredible. I had to stay for a few days for business earlier in the year and with a tight schedule, the hotel and comfort level of sleeping was really important to me.Rooms are very well designed. Bed is very comfortable. Staff attends to every and any need that you might have. I can't say enough good things about their attention to detail and customer service.
1|Great hotel, great location. Win.Win.WinThe lobby bar and tenders super phenomenal with crazy yummy cocktails. The sushi bar is also a wonderful experience, talk about fresh and tending to your every wish.Super quick walk to Ferry terminal and Union Square. Have stayed in San Francisco many times and this will now be my hotel
1|One of the top stays in the U.S., stayed in a suite with an adjoining den.Excellent quality of service including kid size slippers and robe - unbeatable at most other hotels.Ambiance in the hotel is nice, and room is very clean and well appointed.Highly recommend staying here.
1|This hotel is everything you would hope for. Beautifully appointed. Great comfort. Good restaurants and bar. Excellent location. And most of all, a superlative staff. We were treated with care and expertise by this wonderful group of people. I can't remember being this happy in any hotel and I plan to return whenever possible. Highly recommended!,
1|Astonishing with this hotel was the old building left in the middle of shopping centers, high buildings. The tram station was just outside as Wallgreens beside.HM and Macy's etc. What do you ask more for a perfect location I had probably the cheapest room, but it was just perfect. A bath tub to relax my pains. Breakfast wasn't included, but who needs that if there are a hundred places nearby to eat every hour of the day. Hop-on-off buses leave just 100m away. It was just sooo perfect. Early reservation is highly recommended
1|This the first time to San Francisco that I have not stayed in the area of Fisherman's Warf, and the Hotel Vertigo has changed my perspective of San Francisco. The Warf is a great area, but it is all tourists. When we go to SF, we like to walk (a lot) and visit the places the locals go. The Hotel Vertigo is in a great location for branching out all over the city. And, on those days when you just want to hang out - there are plenty of restaurants and bars within blocks. Hotel Vertigo is a seven story boutique hotel. Over the last couple of years I have made the decision to only stay in boutique hotels, and Hotel Vertigo does not disappoint. The rooms are small, but very well appointed. It is apparent that my room had recently been renovated with modern chic. The bathroom was huge with a great rain shower head. The room was on par with some of my recent stays in Madrid and Mexico City. Excellent WiFi coverage all over the hotel. My only complaint was that I had an inside corner room (709) on the 7th floor that adjoined another room. The door to the adjoining room was not very sound proof so I almost clearly heard TV and conversation in the next room. This was only a problem one night for about an hour before a fell to sleep after a long day of exploring the city. The staff here are amazing. They were always ready to help us with directions, taxis and recommendations. The rooms are cleaned very quickly each day with great detail. My friends have been staying at Hotel Vertigo for years and I'm glad they convinced me to stay here this time. I'll be back in a few months with my girlfriend and I know she will love the Hotel Vertigo.,
1|We stayed there for 2 nights and staff were very friendly and helpful. It was in a great location and quite central to restaurants and cafe's. bed was comfy and bathroom was nice and clean. I would go back again if visiting San Francisco.
1|Great location, close to Union Square and bus routes but not right in the middle of all the noise. Convenient grocery stores and coffee shops nearby. The front desk staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. We arrived early and they were quick to arrange an early check-in for us. The rooms are modern and well-appointed. The lobby is bright and comfortable. We were so pleased with our stay. This is a great value in the city!!!,
1|we enjoyed the hotel but it needs more amenities-they were building a new cafe-but there was no bar /gym/breakfast-which is a pity as it is a great building which they have improved.the room was good sized and clean.however the price is way too high for what you receive.
1|Had such a fantastic stay, rooms were fabulous, staff were helpful and always there to help, take away coffee in the morning was a god send to start trekking down to fisherman's wharf approx 30 minute walk and 10 minute walk to union square, fabulous location. Caf across the road open from am for early birds and convenient store and sandwich stop on same street.,
1|Spent 3 nights at the Vertigo and can't really find anything to complain about check in was quick easy and friendly, our room on floor 7 was clean, big enough for us and fairly quiet other than an italian couple who deemed it acceptable at 7am to laugh and chat at the top of their voices! Walls are quite thin Used gym which was good for a hotel this size decent coffee in room and downstairs, good location for union sq and other neighbourhoods all In all a pleasant stay
1|Would recommend for couples-close to a very good restaurant Nobb Hill cafe and walking distance to grace cathedral. Most tours will pick up at this location as well. Free printer ATM and fitness center all made our trip much more convenient
1|Great value for the money and good location to explore SF. Beds are very comfortable and rooms are clean and good size. Only complaints about the room are lack of a comfortable chair and the dresser. The dresser is in the closet and is difficult to access which is annoying during a long stay. There is no exercise room (supposed to be coming) and no business center or conference room ( also supposed to be coming).Would stay again, but just aware of limitations.,
1|We stayed here for five days in the beginning of November. The location is fine for exploring San Francisco, close to transportation and only about ten minutes away from Union Square. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Our early morning wake up call for the half marathon was as requested. We really enjoyed our stay. The coffee in the lobby is great for early mornings.,
1|Very good stay and excellent value for money. Friendly staff and quiet rooms (though no view) it was a great base and one I'd be tempted to use again. It's central Ian big US city so yes they're small but otherwise very good. Staff lovely and location excellent - worth wandering up Hyde or Polk to union for some lovely SF fun. Only downside was that they don't have a car park but they have a good deal with the secure public lot at 840 Sutter - just 200m away.
1|Check in staff were so helpful and cheerful. We arrived quite late and was promptly checked in so we could do rest. The room was spacious and very clean. Shower cubicle was spacious. Toiletries included. Not the best of locations in San Fran but by far not the worst either. We enjoyed the walk to Fishermans Wharf. There's a hop-on-hop-off bus stop fairly close too. Great value for money
1|A nice clean hotel, a little away from all the attractions but a nice friendly hotel. At the time of our visit there was some refurbishments going on, but did not cause any problems. Do not expect any views from this hotel as it in the middle of the town.
1|We stayed four nights at the Hotel Vertigo. It is a great location for many San Francisco attractions if you like to walk and take the cable cars. There are many bars and restaurants near by as well. The room is clean and has all you need. The desk staff is friendly.
1|Booked thru booking.com and got a great rate. The room was very nice and the location is very convenient. I would advise not walking too far down the hill on Leavenworth towards Market. It gets a little seedy, but every other direction is perfect for walking around. The service was great and the rooms are updated. The decor is very nice as well---- room walls are not sound proof in the least, so light sleepers take warning!
1|Nice spacious and modern room. Two large double beds.There was a nice gym that i used everyday which had just enough equipment to keep my happy.Walking distance to union square and most places aren't too much in a cab.Nice coffee in the room and in the morning downstairs.I would recommended this hotel.
1|Loved The Vertigo! Rooms were unique. Hotel was very clean. It's not a 5* hotel but staff was so very helpful. Free wi-fi in the room. Very nice location! Walked to chinatown and Union Square. The only complaint: We were offered a breakfast with our rate and the yogurt was warm. They just had a boxed breakfast sitting in the back room where It should be in the fridge. It's better to go 2 doors down to the breakfast place. It's inexpensive and the food was good. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The men that worked the front desk were the best. They could answer anything and were very helpful. Can't wait to go back someday!
1|1st time we went to this hotel in SF. I was a little cautious with low expectations due to the decent deal i got online with them. Only good surprises: Very nice staff, used to deal with international visitors and making the effort to speak other languages. Rooms are a little small but their design is tasteful. We had a comfortable bed, enjoyed a quiet sleep with almost no noise. If the hotel does not provide breakfast other than Coffee or tea, there' s a chinese 'diner' type at the next corner that will fulfill your needs for cheap.I ll go back there for my next trip in SF
1|Stay for 2 nights on October with my wife. The hotel decoration is very classy, from the lobby up to our room. Check-in and check-out is very smooth. Location wise, even it is close to some major attractions (Union square, etc) but also close to Tenderloin which make us feels a bit insecure (not their fault btw). Only problem is on our last day just before check-out when we waited for the lift for nearly 10 mins. We've got to drag our heavy luggage and found out that the lift is out of service. At least put some sign on each floor that the lift is broken. Otherwise everything else should be ok.
1|Hotel Vertigo was perfect,stayed in room 305 street view very clean,spacious room,lovely shower. Close to union square 10min walk area felt safe despite others previous comments. Definitely recommend.Hi Tandy, Fantastic! Thank you so much for your perfect review! We hope you visit us again the next time back in San Francisco!,
1|Location is fabulous, we walked everywhere as it was so central to where we wanted to go. Rooms were clean and staff extremely helpful - it was our first time in San Francisco and they sorted us with eating advice, cheap hop on bus tickets...Special mention to Cynthia, Ayala and Greg on reception who were great!
1|The hotel has a certain charm all its own. Although the Vertigo has no restaurant , there were plenty of places nearby to choose from. It was cheap, clean and had free Wi Fi. The staff was courteous and helpful. The rooms did lack adequate drawer space and were a little small. The bathroom was cool- I liked the rainhead shower and the H20 products and the flat panel TV. I would still recommend The Vertigo to anyone wanting a inexpensive place to stay with personality.
1|I really liked this hotel and the nice little features in the room. Also, it has a decent gym and the location is also good, maybe 15min walk to Union Square. On the other side, if you are in the wrong room, you can hear your neighbours talking. Even though, the hotel wasn't booked out and they had plenty of rooms available, they put us in the room next to the elevator. During that night, I didn't sleep more than 30 min. After complaining, they gave us a different room which was much better. But why not giving us a quiet room in the first place!
1|Stayed a weekend. Good facilities and friendly staff. I dont agree with the worn down hotel statements. I thought the rooms were great and clean, looked newish.Location is also good, not in the middle of touristy FW, but in walking distance 20min.Dear TomERob,I shared your comments with our entire staff and it makes me happy that we are able to provide exceptional service. ,
1|I spent a week at the quality inn suites in Palm Bay while visiting friends. I learned something new. The king size bed suite is cheaper than two queen beds. The room was on the top (5th) floor they kept the room clean and neat. They had laundry facilities on site (pay washers and dryers) computers to use for boarding...
1|We went on a family vacation last June with our kids (10,8, 4) and our friend recommended that we stay at the Hilton Universal since we really intended to visit Universal Studios since they have a free shuttle that goes around. We didn't have our own car and we had our friend bring us around the city.Rooms were big enough with 2 double beds to accommodate all of us though a little dated. Not much restaurants and shops in hotel and nearby -- mainly good if you're planning to go to Universal Studios.
1|We needed one night in Seward before boarding a boat the next morning into Kenai Fjords National Park. Was choosing between the Best Western and the Holiday Inn. The location of the hotel is downtown, right across the street from the Sea Life Center, very close to Hotel Seward, and there are several restaurants within walking distance including Zudy's which...
1|This has been one of the most accomadating hotels I have ever visited. Whenever I come to this area I book this hotel. The staff is always courteous and they will assist you as much as they possibly can (i.e., early check-in, directions, extra towels and wash clothes, etc.) Most important, you cannot beat the price. The rooms are fine...
1|We were there in winter so there was nothing happening outside. The casino had adequate slots but not much in the way of table games. We did quite well on penny slots......for a change. The front desk lady was very nice and accommodating, but we were early and had to wait for our room...our fault. The room was very large...,
1|Just came back from a great spring break week with our family. The Blue Water Casino/Resort is not 2 1/2 hours from Phoenix...way easier then heading to CA...and way less expensive. Rooms were under 70.00. We were able to get adjoining rooms which was great. I had read thru all the reviews so was not expecting much. From check-in to...
1|Customer service was really good and they were really friendly. Price for this hotel in Jonesboro was really really good. I stayed for 2 weeks for business trip and had no issue. They have updated to flat screen. I did not expect breakfast to be included in this price, so that was a bonus.,
1|Older cabin but great price for 9 women to have girls retreat . Clean but would have been nice ro have washer and dryer. Secluded and quiet. Had a great weekend . Beautiful fall tree colors. Weather was great.Glad you enjoyed your stay! We will take into consideration the washer and dryer. Good idea!
1|This hotel was very clean and nicely decorated. The shower in the King size room was great. The only bad thing I can say about this place was at check out time. My husband checked out ahead of me and while I was carrying down luggage to my car, I had to leave a few items in the room to...,
1|Staff were great!! polite and professional, always available. Continental breakfast is small but satisfying, Coffey's always fresh, rooms were clean and neat. I would highly recommend this motel to friends and family
1|You won't regret your stay here. Beautiful scene, amazing area, and personalized stay. They even have cookies in the lobby! I love the bungalows that sit behind the hotel, it feels like your own cabin!
1|Great inn on the sand, lots to entertain you...or not. Staff was attentive and friendly. Breakfast was limited but, included in rate and certainly did the trick for us. Cannon Beach and The Ocean Lodge will be the base for any future Oregon Coast family...
1|After reading reviews of many cannon beach lodgings, I choose the ocean lodge. Boy am I glad I did. Had an Oceanside room on the first floor with a patio that allowed one to walk right out to the beach. It was covered from the...,
1|We always love it here. The Ocean Lodge is welcoming in all aspects - staff, service, rooms/decor, and location. We did have noisy neighbors with kids above. They were notified. We'll keep coming back.
1|We stayed at the Ocean Lodge in Cannon Beach from May 17 to 20,2014. The location is absolutely amazing . Our room was 15 feet from the white sand beach and the view is one of the most breathtaking I have seen, even compared to...
1|Comfortable and pleasant spot. Great location right in the beach and an easy walk to haystack rock or just a little further to downtown. Wonderful, friendly staff. Lots of little details make this a special spot. We will definitely be going back. Warren pub is...,
1|My husband and I arrived at this hotel, and knew we were booked for a room with a partial view. When we arrived, before we saw our room, we decided to ask if there was another room with a total view. At the registration desk,...,
1|This is one of the nicer places I've stayed... really quite a flawless experience overall. The only problem is that I probably gained five pounds via the bottomless cookie jar and the insanely delicious treats inside. We had a beautiful ocean-front room with an incredible...
1|Both my fiance and I work for big hotel names and wow! The Ocean Lodge knocked it out of the park. From the check in, the room, the amenities, and the check out - they do it perfectly. We stayed in a pet friendly suite...

1|The location is perfect, especially if you have an ocean view room. We arguably had the best room in the lodge - the one on the 2nd floor center, with a vaulted ceiling, facing the ocean. It was a luxury to leave the slider open...
1|Reach out and touch Haystack Rock. Blustery December beach - with big waves. Charming. Christmas tree in lobby, library on second floor by the breakfast nook. You've got to go. And, manager, Wendy Higgins won Oregon Innkeeperof the Year - and we can see why.
1|Just spent the weekend at Buchanan Landing..LTD time Florida at its best! Clean, well equipped serene and on the water...what else can you ask for Gorgeous sunsets, smart fish and personal pelicans! We will be back!
1|Check-In: Buchan's is boutique and is family owned. Check-in consists of walking across the street to the corner market and signing a little paperwork before being presented with the keys on a keychain. Service: Not a whole lot of need for service, but overall the property owners were very nice and accommodating. Room: I was a little nervous about the...,
1|Our family stayed here for one night after a hockey game. The hotel was super clean, right off the interstate, and was located around a few restaurants. The staff was wonderful also. We definitely would stay here again.Thank you for five star review! We are so happy you found the hotel to be super clean and the staff to be wonderful! We look forward to seeing you in the future!
1|Excellent, would definitely stay here again , even though we arrived early we were made to feel very welcome . The room was very comfortable, the Jacuzzi, swimming pool ( heated ) and sauna were superb.,
1|Picked the W for a weekend trip with my boyfriend and wanted to stay somewhere trendy downtown. We were most impressed with the bar - friendly service and great menu (tater tots poke plate were fab!). Booked a spectacular room with a view. View was just looking at a big building (see pic), not a cityscape like I hoped, but I suppose thats the nature of being downtown. Probably would save money on that next time. No fan in bathroom so there was some humidity in there. I also requested a 4pm check out but they could only do 1pm. No big deal and wed still stay here again. Great location and lot of food/drink options within walking distance as well.
1|We had a nice room - view wasn't the greatest (looking at a parking garage). Hotel location was great - near many things including the Farmers Market. Staff was great! - very helpful. Mykaela helped us along the way answering a bunch of questions and checked us out - remembered us by name! Kyle helped - and booked a tour for us. Cleaning staff had the room immaculate every day. All in all, a great visit!,
1|I stayed here 1 night for an overnight layover in Seattle. The hard product isn't particularly special, but my entry-level room was decent, with a comfortable bed, good lighting, conveniently located power outlets, and modern yet unoffensive decor. The view wasn't bad either, with the Space Needle visible in the distance as well as a comfortable couch by the window. In contrast, the bathroom was mediocre, with a shower/tub combo, relatively weak water pressure, and sterile design compared to the rest of the room/hotel. I did have to call to request slippers as I couldn't find any in the room, but they were delivered swiftly.In the past I have steered clear of W hotels due to the impression that they are more style than substance, but the service here was actually very good. I was warmly greeted upon check-in by the friendly clerk, and the concierge desk was also more than happy to recommend some nearby places for a quick dinner (I ended up going with Heartwood Provisions, which was excellent).,
1|Stayed at the W Seattle hotel for 2 nights and had an excellent experience. It was my first time staying at a W hotel property and am definitely going back. From the first point of contact at the front desk (I think the woman who checked us in was namedMikala), to the restaurant staff, and housekeeping - everyone was so welcoming and kind. The rooms were very modern and clean. Good amount of space and great amenities. Hotel is conveniently located within blocks of Pike Place, restaurants, and shopping. I prefer to not stay too close to Pike Place because of the crowds. Starbucks is located right across the street, which is great if you need coffee every morning. Not sure when I'll be back in Seattle, but I'm definitely staying at another W property soon.
1|The same feel and vibe of other W hotels though lighting in room was better than others I have been in. Love the Bliss products. Didn't try the bar or restaurant this time but have in the past. Was decent.
1|W Hotel is a fun and energized hotel because its design. I like W's location and the Bar because I can easily go to many stores and the pike place, and I can enjoy my drink while I enjoy the music, which denoted by DJ. I believe you would fall in love with this young energy musical style W Hoel.
1|I have been staying at the W Seattle since 2010 and have never stayed anywhere else in Seattle as I enjoy my stay. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the cool corners are very nice. The staff over all these years is consistently hospitable and friendly. And the location is ideal, easily accessible to all of Seattle. I very much recommend you give it a try, and maybe you too will become a regular.
1|Check the boxes for a great location and a clean room. That said, this W seems to lack the pop that other W's have. There's nothing special, trendy, or quirky about the rooms. .. a bit of a disappointment. I was also a bit put off by not having a coffee pot available in the room. Although there was coffee available in the lobby, I prefer to get up and make my own. No big deal. In fact, none of this is a big deal... it's just not what I expected when I booked based upon past W experiences. Yes, I'd stay there again.
1|This W is in the heart of all the action. I got a mega suite which overlooks the bay and the city and had a great leather chair to look out the window. The property is in line with most W's, hip, with upbeat energy. The only downside is there is no Bliss spa. The Trace restaurant offered a wide variety of great food. The bartenders were on point, fast, friendly and attentive. The MOD, Anthony was very kind in fixing an issue with my bill, as well as Bryan, who checked me in. Tyler, the bellman was extremely efficient with my luggage at check-in and check-out. I will definitely stay again. Breakfast was very good as well as the service. The housekeeping was on point daily and cleaned my room when I requested, which is not always the case in a lot of SPG properties.
1|As seasons ticket holders for the Seattle Seahawks, we typically drive down from Vancouver then drive back up after the game. This time, we decided to make a night of it and stay at The W Seattle. Received a pre-stay message from W Insider, Mykaela, with great dining recommendations near the hotel. As it was our first night away from our baby boy, I replied back to Mykaela to see if she could set up a special surprise for my girlfriend. She replied back and was excited to help out with my little request. When we arrived, we were welcomed by Rachel, who was inviting and funny, and got us into our room. When we entered the corner room with a west view, right on the desk was a amenity and card from Mykaela, wishing us a happy anniversary, along with the little surprise for my girlfriend a stylishly framed picture of her and our baby boy so that she wouldn't miss him too much. After checking in and refreshing from the drive, a short walk took us to Century Link Field, just in time for kickoff. After a win for the Seahawks over the Eagles, we walked around the city, popped into a little Mexican joint for dinner, then back up to the room to enjoy the city view and Stellina Di Notte amenity.The next morning on our way out, as we were waiting for the elevator, the room attendant on the 17th floor greeted us from another room and thanked us for staying. Nice acknowledgement.At check out, Mykaela was at the desk and got the chance to thank her in person for the personalized service. Stored our bags for the morning to grab brunch, before heading back up to Vancouver. Short but really sweet stay.,
1|Love the W Seattle, it is close to everything in downtown and the service at the hotel is great. We had a nice time in the bar/restaurant as well. It is a great area to hang out and relax as well as talk to friends. The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet and clean.,
1|Even though I've worked for a W property in the past, I had never stayed in one as a guest so I was super excited when we had enough points saved up for a 2 night stay at the W Seattle for our 1st anniversary. Upon arrival, Nina (super sweet and friendly) assisted us and let us know that our room was not ready yet so they stored our luggage and said they would email us when it was ready. We never received an email but headed back around 4pm and it was ready. They had defeathered the room per our SPG profile and even upgraded us to a Cool Corner Room. I was so excited! Their W Insider (concierge) had emailed us prior to the trip and asked if we were celebrating anything special. We told them it was our anniversary and he was able to upgrade us as a surprise. Along with the upgrade, was a bottle of champagne on ice and some homemade gummy bears which totally put a smile on our faces. That's hospitality at its finest. The room was super clean and the view was amazing with 4 large windows. The room also had a really nice chaise lounge that couple be separated into 2 seats or combined for 1 lounge. It was really comfy. The W mattress is also really comfy and I liked that the bed was lower to the ground. The AC was also really quiet which provided us 2 nights of really good sleep. In the evenings, they had live music in the Living Room and after 9pm they had a DJ so it was sort of a party atmosphere at night but no noise could be heard from the room aside from city street noise. Overall, we had a great experience. The staff always greeted us when we walked by and the valet guys always opened the doors for us. I hope to visit again soon!PS- it's a 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. No need to rent a car as everything was within walking distance.
1|We had a lovely stay. The room was lovely, beds very comfy, air conditioning good, nice modern decor, bathroom and toiletries lovely. Bar food and staff lovely. Super central location - All in all a lovely place.Thank you for sharing feedback about your recent visit Amelmato, we're so glad you enjoyed your stay.
1|Convenient to everything downtown. A Starbucks across the street. Early check-in wasn't a problem. Complimentary New York Times. Spacious room with a comfortable bed. Also an easy and enjoyable walk to Capitol Hill.
1|The W's location was super convenient, just a few blocks from the Market and waterfront. The staff was so accommodating and helpful, the rooms were clean and spacious. Overall great experience and I will definitely come again one day!
1|I found this hotel quite comfortable to stay at. Business conditions required that I work overnight and sleep during the day, and the blackout curtain was quite effective at keeping out light. I almost never heard any noise from other rooms or the hallway either, and city noise was nonexistent away from the window (except for the occasional siren). Hotel staff was very helpful with any requests. The exercise room has a lot of equipment for workouts. The bed was very comfortable. Room service is a bit pricey.
1|We had a great stay at the W. The vibe was Seattle cool with live music in Friday night in the lobby. Rooms were modern and clean. Great location to all the attractions, including the light rail from the airport ,
1|Had a good stay at the W Seattle. Wanted to give a 3.5 rating for this hotel. Good and convenient location. About 15 minutes walk to Pike Place Market and 5 minutes to many shopping stores. Lots of restaurants/dining options nearby too. Stayed in a Spectacular room which were fairly spacious and modern. I liked the Bliss product toiletries in the rooms. There is a Nespresso machine in the room. They didn't have any tea/kettle though. Staff were friendly. Their whatever/whenever service is pretty efficient. Now for some of the cons. The temperature in the room was difficult to regulate. Every tiny adjustment would make the room either too hot or too cold. There aren't enough towel bars or hooks to hang towels in the bathroom. The gym was unkept. Noticed some used towels and opened water bottles laying around. Upon check out, we requested for a bellman and followed up two times and no one came. Ended up bringing everything down ourselves and noticed bellmen in the lobby who apparently weren't aware of our request. They were pretty friendly so not sure if it was just some miscommunication between the hotel staff. Had a good stay but not sure if I would stay here again because I wasn't wowed as much as I thought I would be staying at a W hotel. Might go back to staying at the Sheraton Seattle.,
1|Very friendly and service minded staff. Hotel is nice and modern, located only 10 minutes away from the popular fish market. Had a great stay here. Our drawbacks are minor, but iron and iron board was in very bad condition (hardly usable), water seemed too soft, low water pressure in the shower, and a USD 68/night valet brought it down from 5 to 4 for us.
1|This was our first time in Seattle. The first part of our stay was at another hotel but we had to change to the W due to availability. I wish we had just stayed the entire trip at the W. The staff was excellent and the room was amazing. We had a huge room on the 25th floor with a view of the sound as well as the Space Needle. This was the first time we actually spent a great deal of time in the room since the view was spectacular. I would absolutely stay there again should we return to Seattle. IN ALL CAPS TOO, I LOVE IT!,
1|I was impressed with this hotel from the first minute. The staff at the reception desk are immediately warm and inviting. Next I was wowed by the spacious room with a view. The room is beautifully decorated with a fresh modern feel. I love that the toiletries are from Bliss, another touch that makes you feel pampered at your home away from home. ,
1|Hotel is very clean, beautiful and in perfect location. Love that you can walk everywhere but overnight parking is a bit pricing. I requested a view of Elliott Bay and pay a little extra to get the higher floor for the view, it was disappointing - NO VIEW! Overall the stay was comfortable and love the cleanliness of this hotel!
1|We stayed in two rooms for one week. The hotel IS IN the convention center. Had I know this, I would have booked at a smaller place. As a result, it was very crowded and there was no real personal attention. The rooms were clean and offered lovely views. Club level was worth it. Sadly, my young son lost his treasured baby blanket at the hotel. (we think in the laundry). And there were many many tears over that. I think more from me! We asked several times with several people, but it was never found. We are still heart broken.,
1|We stayed here over New Years to celebrate our anniversary, and the hotel went out of their way to make our stay pleasurable. Not only did they provide great service, but we also had a killer view of Pike's Place and the Space Needle from our room. It's also in a great location where you can walk to everything (note though: parking is 30 a night in their parking garage, so you may want to find parking elsewhere). We will be back to stay here again.
1|We live in Seattle but needed to get the baby out of our condo while it was cleaned. He had been sick for two weeks and needed fresh air while our tiny place was being cleaned from top to bottom. The guy in reservations got us a hypoallergenic room with a gorgeous view, crib, baby bathtub and baby products for a discounted rate. Mommy baby got much needed RR. Thank you! We will be sending our friends and family to the Grand Hyatt for the great service, beautiful rooms and gorgeous view! Room 2319 was perfect!
1|I've found the Grand Hyatt to be a well located place to stay when visiting Seattle. The Pike Place Market, which is a must see, is a pleasant 10 minute stroll down the hill. Other tourist attractions e.g. the Seattle Wheel, the Aquarium etc, are approx a 20 minute walk. There are plenty of quaint places to eat including the larger franchise eateries close by.The rooms themselves are spacious and well equipped. The bathroom has a walk-in shower as well as a bath. There is a writing desk as well as a chair and ottoman, so you are able to relax and put your feet up.We were on the 27th floor, with a water view room. Nice outlook of Puget Sound.
1|The Hyatt is situated right in the city. Its a 5 minute walk to Pike Markets and the shopping district.The staff are really helpful. The rooms are pretty standard but the bathrooms are amazing!If you prefer a shower with 2 shower heads, one on either side, ask for a room with this option. My work colleague had a huge bath instead in theirs.Would definitely recommend.
1|My husband and I booked a room here over the past Thanksgiving for two nights when we flew in from North Idaho to celebrate the holiday with our son and his family. The room was comfortable and had nice amenities. Ruth Chris Steak House is attached to the hotel which serves fabulous meals. Expensive but very good quality. As with most Seattle hotels parking is very expensive-around 45 a day and even 30 to self park so our son picked us up when we arrived and then we took a town car when we had to return to the airport. 65 included tax and gratuity and was arranged by the hotel concierge, Molly, who was most helpful. She also told us about the train to the airport but when she said you have a half mile walk from the station to the airline counters we declined. Only around 3.00 so if the weather is good (ours wasn't) and you don't have a lot of packages (we did) it would be the way to go. You can catch the train only two blocks from the hotel. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping, eating or theater going in Seattle. Very close and easy walking distance to major stores and lots of wonderful small ones. Also located next to the convention center so very convenient for that too. We were disappointed to come back from shopping at almost 2:00 and find our room had not been cleaned as yet. We also did not care for the heating system. It has a vent at the top of the wall and when it came on it blasted your head with cold air when you were in bed. Don't understand why it was cold as we had it on heat. These were the only two negatives and we would definitely stay again. Our room was very quiet except for when the idiots in the corner room next to us let their door slam about 12 times around midnight. I was just about to call the front desk when it stopped. They had a nice business center and allowed you to web check in for your flight for free but charge to use the internet.
1|The staff at this hotel always exceeds my expectations. The rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Not to mention the excellent location. The business center staff went out of their way to make this business meeting successful. Quick walk to the seafood market and the original Starbucks and Nordstrom. Highly recommended!
1|The location is perfect. It is an easy walk to any of the Downtown or Belltown attractions and only about a 15 minute walk to Capitol Hill. I attended a conference at the hotel and the staff was very courteous and helpful. My flight arrived in the morning and the hotel was able to accommodate an early check in (at the time I just asked to drop off our bags). The room was clean with a great king size bed and a large soaking bathtub. Overall outstanding service and experience.
1|I have stayed at many of the major hotels in downtown Seattle. I believe the Grand Hyatt delivers the most value for the dollar and would recommend it to others. The location is convenient, the staff is very professional and personable, and the rooms are very well appointed and quiet.
1|Can't go wrong with this hotel. Beautiful rooms and super close to all activity around town. It's situated on 8th street, so a leisurely walk down to 1st takes you to the Pike St markets. Hertz rental car is also based in the car park of the building, so really convenient if you want to drop off or pick up a rental. Staff all really helpful and really pleasant. We had a great stay.
1|Great place to stay. Room a little small. Clean, Quite, People very nice, and Great food Banquets a little shakey i.e. spoiled snacks, lapses in table attension and bar service. Good access from airport by lite rail.,
1|Stayed there a few weeks ago and it was excellent. Right downtown.a short 10 min walk to the market and 15-20 min walk to sky needle and pioneer square. a few blocks from the hustle and bustle, but plenty of activity right around the hotel. Rooms were very clean and up-to-date and all staff (car , bell, desk) very friendly and accommodating. Concierge (forgot her name -- sorry) was especially helpful with any arrangements, printing tickets, directions..etc. would highly recommend this hotel.
1|Just around the corner from the Convention Center. Very convenient! Rooms are very clean and the bathroom is large with a separate tub and large glassed shower. Quiet room. You really cannot hear anything, so it's great for work and sleeping.,
1|Beautiful hotel with plush amenities, polite and helpful staff, great location with a short walk to Pike's Place Market, the Westlake mall, the Monorail pickup to the Space Needle, coffee shops on every corner and great restaurants all around the hotel. Super close to the convention center, too. Great view of Puget Sound along Pine St from room 2520!
1|Ok, for those that are wondering in Seattle where to stay, I successfully picked out the two hotels that are close to all attractions, reasonably priced and had a jacuzzi for helping with the soreness of the feet from walking around to all the attractions! Grand Hyatt and the Sheraton. I had stayed at the Sheraton, which had a nice jacuzzi on top, but wanted to try the Grand Hyatt. We pulled in, had a room readily available, and went to our room. The bathrooms are huge and my wifed loved this. No complaints about the room. The hotel had a nice gym where I was able to workout in the morning with a few of the LA Angels prior to playing the Mariners. Very nice gym with a connecting jacuzzi area. They also had a sauna and a very large and hot! steam room. Connected to the hotel is a really nice Sushi restauant, which if you like sushi, you should check this out as the dishes roll around the restaurant on little conveyer belts. They also had a NY deli style place to grab sandwhiches and a Starbucks. I would stay here. They guys running the valet are very professional as you could tell they know their stuff. The front desk check in was very pleasant. But, one word of caution...nothing to fault of the hotel but more the city of Seattle. My wife and I fell asleep Sunday night around 8pm, thinking we were going to wake up and head out to a restaurant. At 12:15 am, I was out of luck to getting any type of food. Room service closed, so the only thing I could purchase was small little crackers and cookies from the front desk. Not a big deal, but you would think in a city that size you could walk to some place and get a sandwhich. In the morning, I didnt see breakfast, so I think it was all room service. BUT, dont eat there, walk 6 blocks to the Pikes Market and go to Le Panier or Poscky's for pastries. Wonderful Go there early and beat the lines! Eat breakfast at Lowells for crab-dishes.
1|I first stayed at the Grand Hyatt Seattle soon after it opened about 8-9 years ago. I remember loving the hotel. It was new and modern and in a great location and ever since I've always loved it. I recently revisited it and was worried that it could now be showing its age. I'm happy to report that these worries were completely unfounded, the hotel is still amazing. There's a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel, as well as a Starbucks and a sushi restaurant. The staff is very helpful. And the location is great for anything in downtown Seattle, either business or pleasure. But my favorite part of the Grand Hyatt Seattle are the rooms. They are modern and I just love the layout of them. As others have reported, the bathrooms are huge, and the whole entry area of the room has stone floors instead of carpet. The views from the upper floors are also amazing, especially on an unusual clear day. I had room service twice and each time it was good and came quickly. Overall, it's a great hotel. I highly recommend it.,
1|I only stayed for 1 night but it was great. Location was close to pike street market and shopping. Updated and clean rooms, large bathroom with separate shower, and electric blackout shade! The staff were all very friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs.
1|This hotel is a beautiful property. My room was spacious, modern and luxurious. The staff was friendly and I felt at home. This hotel is right next to the Convention Center. There is a Starbucks connected to the hotel. The fitness center included machines, free weights, a hot tub area, steam room and sauna. Thank you for taking the time to share feedback on your stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your room and that it felt like home. Our goal is to make sure you feel welcomed and comfortable. It is nice and convenient to be so close to the Convention Center especially since no umbrella is needed as the walk is fully covered. Hopefully, you had some sun during your stay! We are very proud of our fitness center and are delighted that you were able to make use of it.I will pass along the compliments to our staff as we want to make every guest feel at home in our hotel.We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to Seattle!
1|The Grand Hyatt Seattle is located one block from Convention Center and easy walking to the market and great restaurants. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. The room is nice, clean well appointed with free Wi-Fi loved the automated blackout shade. The Ruth's Chris in the lobby has two happy hours with great appetizers. All in all a nice hotel. The only complaint is the minute you step out the panhandlers hit you up and very aggressive.,
1|Second stay at this Grand Hyatt. Both experiences were very good. Rooms nice - not great but very clean. Some hall noise in room but hotel fairly quiet even though pretty full. Location is very central to both the shopping area downtown, pike market, and capital hill not far walk. Staff very helpful and friendly.
1|Decided to stay somewhere in the heart of Seattle for my birthday. We wanted a place with a bathtub big enough for two but unfortunately the tub was not big enough for one. Room 2920 was comfortable and had a view towards the west with Elliott Bay in the background. You will hear noise from traffic below. I was also disappointed with the thin bath towels. You'd think a place this nice with these room rates would of offered better, thicker towels. The very large shower had some black mold in spots that contrasted with the white marble. Charging for bottled water seems cheap too. Self serve parking 30/day is a bit steep. Seems to me that they could give guests a discount on the parking fees.,
1|Just completed a one night stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We were very happy with everything and can't complain. The staff was professional and courteous. Everyone from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff was friendly and always greeted us.Jason checked us in immediately and was extremely nice, efficient, and welcoming. The house keeping staff does a great job in keeping the rooms clean. The decor was modern, the bathrooms beautiful. We were upgraded at no additional charge to a corner suite, maybe because of our Platinum status or maybe because it was a monday. The view was amazing and we loved the electronic blinds and huge room. There is a great shuttle run by Gray Line that takes you to the hotel for 17 dollars round trip, 10.25 one way. We only took the shuttle from the hotel which left at 15 minutes past the hour and 45 minutes past the hour. It was right on time and took less than 45 minutes including two stops at other hotels prior to arriving at the airport. Much cheaper than a 30-40 dollar plus tip cab ride. We have gone to the restaurant Brooklyn on this trip and our last trip also. The entertainment book provides a buy one get one free coupon for it and the food although pricey is worth it. The entertainment book provides many buy one get one free coupons to local attractions including the art museum, Victoria Clipper, aquarium, and others. The hotel is in a good location to attractions and shopping.Pikes market is a straight 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. It is right next door to an awesome movie theatre and the Cheese Cake factory. If you can get a great deal this is a hotel that I would go back to.
1|Checked in the day before leaving on an Alaskan cruise. Had nothing but a grand experience. The hotel is a couple of small blocks away from the monorail that goes to the Space Needle and other attractions. Our room was clean, reasonable size, huge bathroom. Even though we were close to the elevators, the rooms were very quiet. Would definitely stay there again + was a really good rate, several dollars cheaper than near the pier. No complaints!,
1|Without a doubt this hotel is beautiful, immaculate and the staff is very courteous. I would expect no less of a hotel of this caliber. What blew me away was their friendliness and hospitality toward our one year old baby boy. When they found out we were traveling with a baby we were placed in a beautiful corner room with a separate area for our son to sleep. Anyone traveling with babies will understand how valuable this is! You can hear the traffic noise on the street below but we traveled with a white noise machine that blocked the noise. We requested a travel crib and they delivered the crib already assembled with extra towels and wash cloths and a set of travel size Johnson and Johnson bath products. These little touches made this mama's heart so happy! I would give more than 5 stars if possible.,
1|Everyone there was amazing and the prep before my arrival was stellar. They ensured I had access upon check-in to the Olive 9 property so my son could take advantage of the swimming pool. Room service was great and the views from our hotel were fantastic.
1|We were given a beautiful room overlooking Pike's Market and the Bay. Nice size rooms and wonderful bathroom. Staff was welcoming and remembered our names as we went in and out of hotel. Well located for all public transportation and restaurants. In the middle of all the best shopping. Walked everywhere or took public transportation wherever we needed to go.
1|The Grand Hyatt in Seattle is always consistently great! I am greeted on sight by my name and the staff always remember my preferences and inquire about my needs. The room standard is very high quality and comfortable, providing much needed respite from traveling. I am a frequent traveler and prefer the Hyatt over most other brands.,
1|Had an extended weekend stay to celebrate big anniversary! This hotel looked very nice and had a perfect locale so we took a chance. We made a great choice! The hotel is perfectly clean and very large. We got a suite with a bay view and it was perfect. We even had a view of the famous red Public Market sign! No trouble locating Pike's Place with that view! Room was spotless and bed super comfy. Pillows are little lacking too soft, no support but we still slept really well. Check in was a breeze. When they heard it was our 25th, the gal comped our valet for the entire stay and sent up a bottle pinot grigio! We appreciated her thoughtfulness and enjoyed the wine. Bathroom is luxurious and spotless. Huge shower and separate huge tub were glorious! First time spending a significant amount of time in Seattle and we loved every minute. Thanks Hyatt, we'll be back!
1|World class, clean, great location, modern design, almost next to the convention center.,
1|I stay at a Suite at this Grand Hyatt at least 2-3 times a year for at least a week each time. I can say, with a degree of certainty, that they've stepped it up significantly. It's undergoing a renovation. The staff is exceptionally courteous, helpful and professional. I received a letter from Mr. Robert Morrison (Area Director of Rooms) and the assistance of Mr. Steve Vissotzky (Managing Director) and Ms. Sarah Sawatzky (Executive Assistant). I was impressed. I can afford to stay where I wish and it's changes such as this and the staff that make me want to continue to come back.
1|We had the best experience at this hotel. The staff was friendly and cordial, the amenities were exceptional and our room exeplified luxury. We stayed on a corner suite with windows facing dt and the bay and it was spectacular! Most comfortable beds and pillows ever and incredibly modern. It was the best place to go to for our anniversary. Centrally located as well.,
1|The Seattle Grand Hyatt gets high points for location and room quality. You can ignore the complaints about the price of parking, because there is no need to bring your car here. All of the downtown attractions are within easy walking distance, as are the train to the airport, light rail to Lake Union, the monorail to the Seattle Center, and buses to pretty much everywhere else. If you're allergic to transit, the hotel will call a cab or car service for you. And if you truly enjoy driving in traffic, there are cheaper places to park nearby. Be sure to ask the concierge for information on discounts to museums and events. If you want to work out, the gym is fabulous, with lots of high-quality cardio and weight equipment. Bring your swimsuit so you can enjoy the sauna, steam room, and whirlpool. And, although as a rule I don't believe in room service, especially in a city with such good local restaurants, the breakfast that we ordered in-room compared favorably to the best food we had anywhere else - good fresh fruit, excellent bread, local cheese, perfectly-cooked eggs delivered hot, top-of-the-line condiments and a not-too-sweet yogurt parfait. Really, you can trust me. It's worth it.
1|Used up the last of my Hyatt Gold Points for a mini Sta-Cation at the local Grand Hyatt. It was a very choice. I paid for an upgrade to a corner suite, with a view... Of more buildings Not sure I needed to see more of the buildings.Five stars for me on this!Overall, and very nice hotel, very clean, well appointed rooms, plus the corner suites are very large, with a separate sitting area, bathroom, and bedroom. All very nice.Hotel reception was nice, very nice young man who checked us in, good sense of humor (which is very important, that he understands my jokes!). Bell man could have acknowledged my wife and I walking through, but decided to stare blankly out the door... Not sure about that (long day I guess).Sampled the attached restaurant for Happy Hour, which was very nice.Wish our Sta-Cation could have lasted longer, but we needed to head home.,
1|Have stayed at over 30 Hyatt properties, this one was among the best I have seen. Exceptional property, exceptional service. Really went out of their way to make us feel welcome and appreciated. Would definitely recommend.
1|We have stayed in many hotels in Seattle over the years. The Grand Hyatt is one of the best hotels in town. It's location can't be beat and the staff is always very nice. I would always recommend this property to anyone traveling to Seattle as it's one of the best run Hyatts in the USA.
1|Stayed just 1 night then moved to a different hotel by the Mariners stadium for the game. The hyatt was very classy as they always are. Spendy, but you get what you pay for in the service and quality of the hotel.,
1|ask for a good view- particularly, you can get one of several rooms with a direct view of the space needle. the prices are reasonable for a big city, and the rooms are fairly spacious. the rooms are clean, and the lobby and common areas are quite nice. a ruth's chris in the lobby is a plus. service is great. this is convenient to pioneer square, pike's place market.,
1|We have stayed in many of the downtown Seattle hotels from the hip to the old school and this is by far the best hotel - great service, airy and well appointed rooms - everything works like it should in this price range. We especially liked the location - you can walk everywhere and the neighborhood around this hotel feels safer than some other downtown areas... the hotel is especially convenient to the light rail network so an easy trio in from the airport and a short walk.Our only minor quibble (and this is minor in the big scheme of things, but an area Hyatt may want to look at) is charging a 1/bottle of drinking water - in a 300+/night hotel the water should be free and plentiful!
1|Stayed here while attending the US Open. We came a few days early to enjoy Seattle. This hotel had been recommended to us by friends who live in Seattle. The location was so central we were able to walk everywhere! Very friendly staff from concierge to housekeeping. We stayed on the concierge floor and ate breakfast there each day - food was great and service was wonderful. This is a well run hotel in a great location. Would definitely recommend it.
1|This hotel is located a few blocks from the Westgate Link station, so you can easily get around Seattle. Pike Market is a short walk and you can even walk to the waterfront if you like. Check in service is excellent, the front desk and the hotel workers are always friendly and willing to help out. Room is very clean with a large bathroom. My only complaint is the ice machines are not located on all floors, although the hotel says they can someone up with some ice for you. Also the safe in the rooms are located on a high shelf in the closet, see pictures, if you were a short person not sure you could even use it.The hotel does not have its own restaurant, you need to walk next door to the Ruth Chris to eat, but they were open for breakfast. There is a Starbucks and a small convenience store near the hotel.Although the hotel had some minor issues, I would stay here again next time I visit Seattle.
1|What a great hotel and a fantastic city. Three days was definitely not enough. Front desk staff were amazing and room was more than comfortable. Revisiting is most certainly on the cards for this one.
1|Recent trip to Seattle and stay at Grand Hyatt were great. The hotel is clean and the staff were all very welcoming. The location of the hotel could not have been better. The convention center is close by and shopping is right outside the door. It is within walking distance to the Pike Place Fish Market
1|Grand is the right word. Location is Grand, Check in was Grand, room was Grand and the Club was Grand. A shout out to Louise the Concierge, I will call her the Grande Dame of the Grand Hyatt for helping us book a luxury wine tour at the last minute. When you book on the Club level you have a choice of a room with combo bath and shower or a walk in shower. The walk in shower is pretty Grand. This is a high end hotel 400+ a night so a good place to use your points.
1|The entire experience was great and satisfying. The staff, the facility, and the environment was very conducive and comforting. The free wi-fi was excellent, the food was fantastic and the proximity to downtown as well as to the Space Needle was priceless.
1|We stayed in this hotel for a week. The staff was great, room had lots of great amenities, walking distance to Capitol Hill, pikes market, the space needle, and a shopping malls. Also, great views of the city. I will definitely stay here again on my next Seattle visit.
1|It was nice to stay. All facility was excellent but expensive. I know this grade of hotel must be expensive but I am not going for my personal travel. My friends stayed with me and his room was kind of old. Shower was not working well. Anyhow most of services are just great. Thank you.
1|I came for a conference, paid 30 for an upgrade to a corner suite (when reserving), well worth it. Living room, separate bedroom, large bathroom and closet. Great location at the east side of downtown by convention center, near the freeway, light rail to the airport (and underground stations for downtown buses), and Capitol Hill. Room was quiet, clean internet 9.95 a day. Hotel was modern decor, lots of wood, pleasant atmosphere. Ruth Chris is in the lobby, very good for lunch (didn't have breakfast or dinner there, so many other good choices nearby). Would definitely consider staying here again (though I'm a SPG Platinum elite).
1|We enjoyed our stay at the Seattle Hyatt. Helpful staff and a great location close to shopping. Sign up for their rewards program - at no cost - and get free Wi-Fi and other freebies. We were upgraded to a corner suite for only 12.00 additional per night. Suite was very nice and we appreciated the extra room.
1|Planned weekend getaway to celebrate a birthday. Upgraded reservation to club level to have access to grand club which essentially provides breakfast and evening snacks and beverages. Worth it. Pro: location to downtown and walking distance to Pike's market. Grand club breakfast was outstanding. Gym, sauna, and hot tub are fantastic. plenty of places to eat near by Cons: 30.00 self park, 50.00 valet parking. Petty issue but double beds are not ideal for comfort.
1|I decided to try a new property for my frequent business trips to Seattle and I am so glad I did! I found the Grand Hyatt to be superior for quality, comfort and value. The room and bathroom were very generous for a city property it felt more like a lush studio than a hotel room.,
1|Great location, as well as wonderful, caring service. I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt in Seattle. Good catering for our meeting with local, sustainable foods. Rooms are spacious and provide vast views of the city. Parking is expensive (30 per night)
1|Located on Pine, near the Convention center, this hotel is first class. The rooms are nicely appointed and very comfortable. Compared with other major cities the prices are reasonable. It's easy walking distance to local attractions, plus it's just a short walk to the Monorail station that goes to the Space Needle.
1|My wife and I stayed here while visiting Seattle. The property is ideally located, near the monorail, close walking distance to the market and shopping. The staff is very professional, the hotel is very clean, secure and quiet. I have no complaints. I recommend upgrading for a room with a view of the harbor.,
1|What a pleasant surprise. I stayed in this hotel because I was attending a conference. The rooms are greatand I am picky. The bathroom was nice with granite/marble (who can tell the difference anymore). Bed was great. Nice size room. Really nothing negative to say. I am typically a boutique hotel kind of guy for vacation, but if you are looking for a nice hotel in downtown Seattle, this is not a bad option. I stayed at the W before I moved to this hotel. I liked this hotel better than the W. Quite a statement coming from someone who has stayed at several W hotels around the world and recommend them. If the rate is decent, consider this option. It is typically that big hotel feel, but worth the stay.,
1|I stayed at the Grand Hyatt because I was attending a downtown Seattle conference and it was one of the selected conference hotels, although not the main hotel. I was upgraded to a corner king suite the room was very nice, and convenient since I was with my husband. Two separate rooms always makes life easier on the road, especially for a longer stay.The overall look of the hotel, including our room, was very fresh and pleasant. Very clean as well. We like the fact that many Hyatts now share space with Starbucks--very handy and a nice low-cost option for breakfast.The hotel lived up to our expectations, which were not too high since it is not positioned as a luxury hotel, in most ways. We did find the service a bit off. It seemed as though there were too few staff available to help--long lines at check in and out--but then that may have been a result of staying over a holiday weekend.,
1|Great hotel in the center of Seattle. Hence, easy walking to whole downtown. Mark, the manager was delightful. Kristen another manager was very helpful. We came over from Hyatt at Olive. Their hot tub was out of order. No problem to give us a room in the Grand.Hope to return again and again. I like that they offer free wifi in the room
1|Seattle has so many great hotels it was hard to choose. We only sayed one night prior to our Alaskan cruise, and it exceeded expectations. Beautiful, clean, marble bathroom with soaking tub, great toiletries. Comfy, clean bed, great service. Decent view of the city. PERFECT location. The whole experience was a pleasure and we will return.
1|best experience ever, not a single issue at this hotel. gorgeous room, comfortable bed and linen. quite room would definitely stay here again on my next trip. this room even had electric shades . what else is there to say
1|Large hotel in the city, but quiet and incredibly nice-in a very nice area. Easy walking to great stores and local venues. We had a corner suite on the 24th floor-great views of the city-with a ton of room. Love this hotel will be back for sure.,
1|We stayed for 5 days in a hypo-allergic room on the 23 floor, facing east. It was quiet and private and cleaner than any room we've ever stayed in. Everything was first rate from maid service to vehicle valet. Starbucks on first floor as well as New York style deli and Ruth's Chris restaurant. Originally we wanted to stay closer to Pikes Place Market but this location turned out to be more centrally located. We plan on staying here again next year.,
1|I loved my stay here. It was very easy to get around and walking distance to a lot of attractions. Train station and monorail was close. The market was close and you could find anything to eat you wanted close by.
1|Stayed in a bay view room at beginning of week as well as a city view room at end of week.. Bay view room was larger and had great views toward water. City view room was nice but smaller. Good location for all things near waterfront. Monorail to Sky Needle just a couple of blocks away. Would definitely stay here again...
1|We booked the Hyatt for our weekend in Seattle to see Steve Martin and Martin Short.The hotel is dog friendly and in walking distance of the Paramount theatre where the show was at.The parking isn't the best here but it's Seattle, so it's expected. We paid 35 for overnight parking. Once you get parked just walk everywhere, I love walking around Seattle.The only complaint I had was the pet fee changing from the time I booked it until the time we actually stayed. The fee had gone up 50. I didn't complain or say anything because I just didn't feel like having a dispute about it. I also wish they'd had an area for the dogs to do their business, luckily I always carry poop bags, but my Dog had to go very suddenly on the street because I couldn't find a green space close enough, so I just picked it up of course.I guess with big cities it's harder to have an outdoor area for pets.Now to all the great things, which was pretty much everything.The lobby was beautiful, nice lighting, everything was clean, there were large hallways and huge ceilings.Our check in was quick, easy and friendly.We were given a room on the 29th floor with a great view of the city.The room had huge windows, it was a really clean room, spacious and beautiful.The bed was really comfy and also very clean.The Bathroom was massive and I really mean that, it has a gorgeous soaking tub, walk in shower, toilet and vanity area. You have lots of amenities with this hotel.There is a nice hallway space and an awesome do not disturb button that turns a light on and you don't have to hang something on your door, loved that.We had food and drink options that were attached to the hotel in the front, which is always nice for a quick and easy option.We ordered room service with our TV remote. The breakfast that came was delicious, very prompt and with friendly service.We slept amazingly with the fantastic bed and black out shades.When we came back into our hotel on the Saturday afternoon/evening before the show we got on the elevator with a Seattle Mariner, that was pretty cool.Everything about our experience here was perfect from the moment we arrived to the moment we sadly left.This was a bit of a splurge but I hope that one day we can stay here again.I also wanted to add that every staff member I encountered was always friendly to myself, my DH and our Dog.Thanks for a great weekend in Seattle for the show.,
1|The Grand Hyatt in downtown Seattle offers an extremely comfortable a spacious room, with a nice view from the upper floors that face west. The bathroom is large, with extremely nice shower and bathtub. The room is quiet and well insulated from sounds from other rooms, although you emergency vehicles driving can be strangely loud. You can open a small window to get some fresh air too.
1|The location is great. Close and easy access to shopping and Pike Place. Rooms were very nice and comfortable. Front desk wasn't very helpful though. The downside was the price I had to pay for parking.
1|I stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Seattle Tuesday through Saturday with my wife. The hotel is beautiful, trendy with very good service. It is just across from the convention center and has a Ruths Chris (that even serves breakfast), a Starbucks, NY-style deli, and Blue C Sushi attached. A Cheesecake factory is on the corner of the building but not attached to the Hyatt.The doorman, valets, bellman (especially Jazz), front desk and maids were all very good. We chose a club room which served a decent breakfast but seemed to skimp on the variety of food items for the evening appetizer drink session. The club room did have very nice computer stations, TVs, chairs and couches, and a fantastic view.The room was certainly large enough with a very comfortable king-size bed. What disappointed my wife and me was that the desk (i.e. the place to put your computer, cell phone, etc.) only had one available wall plug, hidden and inconveniently located behind the desk. Most hotel desks have lamps with electrical outlets in their bases, or several outlets purpose-built into the desk. Not so with our desk just a plain desk and one hidden plug. Also, only every third or fourth floor had an ice machine. When I needed ice (which was daily so my wife could ice her post-op foot) I had to go from the my 25th floor room to the 28th floor - or call for ice and wait.They also only provided two glasses for the room and no paper/plastic cups. We prefer to use two glasses for drinks and have two in the BR. When we would bring glasses down from the club to put on the bathroom counter, they were consistently gone in the morning. Moreover, the towels were remarkably thin and limp, not what youd expect from a high-end hotel and they only provided two hand towels and two not-so-large bath towels. (The towels at the Staybridge Inn and Hampton Inns where we also stayed on our trip were much larger and more plush and each gave us four of each.)We were surprised and disappointed that Hyatt would cut corners on the Club food, towels, and a decent computer desk. Otherwise, we had a nice stay and would consider staying there again.
1|The Hyatt Seattle was a wonderful choice for our conference. The staff was always willing to offer advice on local attractions and food, or just general questions answered with a smile every time. The room was so comfortable I slept better than I do at home and I didn't want to leave. Definitely will be my choice next time I visit Seattle.,
1|This hotel is amazing! The rooms are spotless, beds are incredibly comfortable, staff is nice. The gym is incredible, with personal TVs on every machine and ice cold towels to cool off with. The location is great, with shopping every way you turn. While my husband was in business meetings, I kept myself busy roaming the stores in the area. It is an easy walk to Pike's Place Market, which is a must-see experience! So many awesome vendors with unique items to sell. It's the only place I have ever found something personalized with the correct spelling of my daughter's name. :) It was my first visit to Seattle, and I had a wonderful time. The hotel was perfect in every way. I would recommend to all.,
1|Every stay at the Grand Hyatt in Seattle is memorable. They have every luxury well thought out and the location is in walking or taxi distance to all the best Seattle has to offer. The rooms are comfortable and the staff is very gracious.
1|This is a great hotel right where you want to be in Seattle close to everything transportation outlets malls very nice would recommend it to anyone clean safe I felt right at home and I will be back loved the service of the hotel
1|Stayed here for a week on a business trip, so got to know the hotel well. Very comfortable, well appointed with all you'd need (and expect) from a Grand Hyatt hotel. Convenient location in centre of downtown, close walking distance to office district, shopping, great selection of restaurants and 20 min walk from wonderful Pike Place Market. In-hotel restaurant is top end qualify, if slightly pricey, but good for breakfast. Service throughout the hotel is excellent, especially the guys out front who call you cabs.Tip for alternative breakfast option go to deli shop linked next door for great sausage muffins/ bagels coffee - delicious and served by lovely people.In summary, a great hotel from which to enjoy the city of Seattle!
1|Decided to stay at the Grand Hyatt following our son's wedding for a day of R R. It was extremely nice with quiet surroundings, wonderful view and excellent service. Would HIGHLY recommend the location, the hotel and the brand
1|It is always a pleasure to stay at the Grand Hyatt nice rooms, great amenities and terrific staff. The consistency of the experience is also quite nice - no surprises, just a quality and peaceful stay. I recommend the Grand Hyatt to all travelers who want a home away from home experience and no hassles along the way.
1|Had a great stay our room was very clean and very peaceful. It is in the heart of DT Seattle. We took the train to the hotel and it was pretty easy. We enjoyed walking all over downtown Seattle no need to rent a car. Major shopping and amazing restaurants right around the corner! We will stay here again!
1|I always feel like I am coming home when I return the the Grand Hyatt Seattle. Great staff and great hotel. It is a big hotel with the feel of a small boutique hotel that very much values my business. I am over 80 nights at Hyatt hotels YTD and this one of my favorites.
1|I am not always the big hotel person, they can seem bland to me. But the Hyatt was spectacular: We entered and we were greeted by Michael at the front desk on check in, who when he learned that it was our anniversary sent up some champagne and chocolates, the view from our room, the fabulous workout room (basically a nice gym with sauna and whirlpool), a beautiful bathroom and just a feeling of ease the whole time contributed to our relaxing visit. The workout space was heaven (and I usually hate working out but I enjoyed it here). You can also use the spa and workout space at the hyatt across the street which is even more extensive.We got free wifi too which is something you don't always get with business hotels. It is near the convention center which in some towns can be in a funky area of town. We were just a few blocks from Pike's Place Market, A good retail shopping district seemed to surround us and it was easy to get around.I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a more upscale stay.
1|I attended a conference for 4 days. The room was ideal for what I needed. The upgrade to a suite allowed for business to take place in my room without a bed in the middle. The bathroom was fantastic as noted by others. I enjoyed the fitness area, although a little confined relative to the size of the hotel and the fitness-minded Seattle population. The cab ride isn't bad and is under 50. I had colleagues that did the train for much less money and minimal trouble. Walking distance to great restaurants and the riverfront made the location very convenient.,
1|Elegant and contemporary interiors without being gaudy. Attentive service. Close to downtown shopping, Convention Center, and business, Pike Place, and more and just a couple blocks from LightLink, too, from SeaTac! Club lounge is immaculate. Ruth's Chris offers restaurant and in-room dining for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Had high expectations upon booking through VISA Signature Hotels program, and was blown away.
1|Great location - close to shopping areas and tourist attractions.Great gym - nice facilities with sauna and steam room, but I wish they are open 24 hrs like the gym is.Friendly staff an easy check in process.Access to Starbucks, Ruths Chris, and deli mart from the hotel.
1|Hotel was great!! The rooms were nice and clean. The view of the convention center was a bummer, but the power shades were great. The staff answered all questions and heped with directions. Valet was outstanding!!! Only bad part was the tax on the room and 9.5 sales tax... Ouchie Mama!!,
1|The bathroom (size,soaking tub, walking shower stall, robes) is in the same league as Bellagio but with a bit extra...complimentary toothpaste, cotton balls/q tips. Yes, they even have a coffee maker (which Bellagio doesn't offer). The same with both hotels, electronic sensor frig, move anything and it will appear on your bill. There's a Starbucks downstairs off the elevator. So convenient to the name brand shops and restaurants. It was enjoyable. Got complimentary wifi for our stay. The electric shade works very well. We requested a late checkout ( 1 hour) but wasn't granted one. There's a complimentary umbrella to use in the closet in case of rain. Safe in the closet.,
1|My husband and I arrived a day early for our cruise to Alaska. I tried to find a centralized hotel where everything would be within walking distance of the hotel. We were greeted outside the hotel by very friendly hotel staff. The simple expression by the hotel staff to greet me by my name is well worth my visit. The hotel room was clean and very comfortable. The bell hop made it a point to go over everything in our room, give us his name and make a quick get away. The hotel was in a perfect place to walk Pikes Place, the Space Needle and all the shopping venues around the hotel. The martini bar around the corner offered some really good Bloody Mary's and buffet breakfast. Very impressed by the hotel.
1|Check in was quick, which is always a plus. The room I stayed in was clean and well appointed with a radical view of the city. Where they truly shined was the breakout sessions they put together during my conference. The food for said breakouts was tasty as well as thoughtfully and artistically displayed. One breakout had all food floating, on mini boats, around a moat the had made in the common area.
1|This hotel has what it takes to enjoy a Seattle exploration. It is surrounded by every area one must visit within a city that has so many facets to admire. The property has all of the amenities...a Starbucks, a steak house, a deli, a sushi bar, and a great fitness center to work them off. We walked everywhere with ease, and watched the world from a panoramic view from our picture frame window. To say that we were pleasantly surprised would, well, cover it....,
1|We had a lovely Christmas staycation at the Grand Hyatt Seattle (seriously, we took the bus from our home in Redmond to get here).We were greeted with a hot chocolate and christmas cookie bar... as well as an upgrade to a water view room!The hotel is within walking distance to all of the main downtown sites. We ordered room service for breakfast and were happy with our waffles. There is a Starbucks right downstairs, so we got coffee from there and brought it back up for a Christmas Eve treat.The workout room was really high end and clean. There was also a sauna and hot tub - I wish I brought my swimsuit!The Grand Hyatt made our staycation overnight stay very special.
1|We were here recently for a business/pleasure trip. Business in that we did not pick the hotel but the meeting picked it. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is very nice, super convenient to everything, staff was outstanding and the room was clean and comfortable. While we usually prefer a smaller more boutique style hotel, this was absolutely a great alternative. Would definitely return to the meeting if it is held here next year. Free Wifi, water in rooms, lots of nice touches.
1|The location is fabulous. Walk to everything . Great gym at the property. Ruth Chris is attached and has two Happy Hours each day. Check it out! My one complaint was that housekeeping really did not do a good job. I kept asking for extra towels, turndown service, shampoo, coffee........ They just could not get it right. Asked for hangers, took three calls to get hangers. Other than that, the place was wonderful. Would stay there again.
1|Wonderful large rooms. Well kept. Walking distance to Seattle highlights and monorail and Link. I recommend this hotel if you need to be downtown or want to get by in city without a car. Service was top notch and I will stay here again.
1|Every aspect of my stay was wonderful. The staff was friendly, polite, professional, and genuinely caring towards their guests. Food provided at the conference was delicious and healthy with tons of options. The room was super clean, comfortable, and luxurious. Thank you for such an amazing stay at your hotel!! I hope to be back again soon!
1|Excellent service from the staff. Great location. Extremely clean and classy hotel. Awesome hotel room with quite possibly the most beautiful hotel bathroom I've ever stayed in. Can't go wrong with this place. Awesome experience.
