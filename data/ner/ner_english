I have status with Hilton so they did lower my parking to 10 per day but it was still annoying and felt like they were simply trying to generate more revenue... particularly due to there was PLENTY of parking.

I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior.

And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well.

And here it is in their hot breakfast like you are supposed to dive in and just eat those bacon scraps as if they are slices of morning bacon. Not me!The coffee maker in the room saved the day for us, because it was actually much better than expected.

He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable, as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so.

("We stayed here for one night with our 2 young kids. As mentioned in other reviews, some of the suites are quite small, although some of that is probably just due to having a divider in the middle of the two parts. It was nice having a divider between us and the kids, even if it was just a clear door. The one suggestion I would make to improve the property would be to have either clouded glass or curtains over the glass part of the doors so that they're not completely transparent. That way you can still watch TV after the kids have gone to bed without worrying about waking them up.While the rooms show some use, the property has been kept up well. The pool was clean and heated and there are some nice areas for eating outside in the perfect San Diego weather. The hotel is about 10 minutes from Sea World, Mission Bay, and downtown,so its a quick jump to everywhere, although the downside is that nowhere is within walking distance. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They were very accommodating when we requested a crib for the room and, after we left one of our phone chargers, they went to our room and called us when they had found it. Service like that is what makes this hotel go from just average to very good.Overall, this hotel is a solid choice, as long as you don't mind driving to the local attractions. Also, just as a tip, there's a parking fee for parking in the lot, however, you can park on the steet for free, as long as you can find a spot.",{"entities":[(786,811,"LOCATION"),(296,300,"FURNITURE"),(975,980,"PERSONNEL"),(1155,1162,"PERSONNEL")]}),

A+ for Location!Once we entered our room, the only negative thing about this whole expreience was the smell of Freshly baked Subway Bread!

("I always have a free bed in SF, so paying for a hotel bed seems odd, but I was here on business. If you've already committed to spend SF hotel money to stay near attractions, this isn't a bad spend.Pros: location - the Powell St. cable car ends two blocks away from you on the opposite corner of the block of buildings you would be in. Theaters and museums are mere blocks away. Bed - my goodness was this bed comfortable. I don't sleep well on most hotel mattresses, but I did here - which is good because I was here for a week! Wifi - complimentary and pretty good from my room. They have accessible rooms - which oddly enough I got, though I don't need it. Refrigerator in the room! Victory for me. I have medical needs for one, hate shelling out extra, and it is also convenient for keeping fresh fruit and other items cool so I don't have to shell out for the overpriced, less-than-great breakfasts nearby. Individual climate control - it does actually get hot in SF on occasion. The air conditioning did its job.Cons: location - there is a nightclub across the street and these windows don't appear to be double-glazed! They DO have ear plugs in the rooms and I was asked at check in if I needed a street-side or interior room. I was not facing the nightclub, but still got noise when the restaurant downstairs took out the trash at late/early hours. Age. This property IS renovated, but its age shows in spots, like in the wiring that's on the wall instead of behind it and closets that are ridiculously small. Air conditioning is by unit in the window. Some people don't like this (I do). Housekeeping: they didn't seem to want to replace things in the bathroom (i.e. washcloths, not soap) and the toilets are dual flush. Even full flush doesn't... um... always do the job. Ahem. Also, the panhandlers will be waiting for you. Don't head west on some of the nearby streets (esp Eddy). That is the Tenderloin. If you are looking for what the Tenderloin has to offer, well, then go ahead.The list of cons is longer, but I find fault easily - take it for what its worth.

The room was small, but there was room for my suitcase, I could hang my clothes in the closet, I could work at the desk, everything was clean, and the room was quiet.

("I stayed here for a few days in a double bed room.Pros:- room clean- mattress and pillows very comfortable- free wi-fi - location very good: downtown, 3 minutes from the cable car terminus on Powell Street- staff friendly and professional.Cons:- given the location, it's a bit noisy at night. Well, downtown San Francisco is a bit noisy, so I guess you'll have the same issues in any hotel there- one of the two elevators was broken, so there was only one, slow elevator serving the whole hotel. You could wait 10 minutes before getting it, so more than once I decided to take the stairs. However, this should be a temporary issue, since I saw they were working on it- the wi-fi was nearly useless--not only communicating via Skipe was impossibile (which might be understandable, given the bandwidth frequired), but also surfing the Web was a hard thing to do at times. This is really an issue they should solve, since it can be done easily and quickly- they don't serve breakfast. There's a restaurant (Puccini Pinetti) which is accessible straight from the hotel, however it opens at 11am, so you can only get a brunch. Anyway, no big issue: there is plenty of places around there where you can have breakfast.Price: I found a discount, so I think the price was fair, otherwise I would say it's a bit costy.",{"entities":[(69,77,"FURNITURE"),(82,89,"FURNITURE"),(121,129,"LOCATION"),(207,221,"PERSONNEL")]}),

("Hotel Abri has a good friendly team of front desk staff and a simply trendy lobby that gave me a good impression to start. The room is small and only minimally functional for a group of four (I should've checked the footage before I booked a double room for four). We had a street-facing room so it was really really noisy at night given the frequent ambulance, passengers and especially the construction noise that went beyond midnight (I didn't know that construction was allowed after 11pm in SF). Service and notes in the room were a bit confusing and inconsistent. There was no introduction pamphlets describing services of the hotel, no sign in the room stating that the water bottles weren't free. Out of my four night stays, one night I did not have enough towels, one with water not replenished, and another without any coffee/tea replenished in the room. Other minor inconvenience include not having hand soap provided, and the hotel does not have shoe horns to lend out. At the end I would still give this hotel a positive vote given their friendly front desk service and convenience of location.",{"entities":[(22,55,"PERSONNEL"),(127,131,"FURNITURE")]}),

("This was my first stay at this hotel and with the Larkspur brand of hotels. I have been to San Fran a countless number of times and have always stayed in Union Square at other hotels (Hotel Nikko, Kimpton, etc). I must say that this hotel was very nice. It wasnt a large hotel (4 floors) but it was perfect and allowed for a better guest experience in my opinion. The rooms were nicely appointed and extremely clean, very modern. They are on the tight side but that is normal for SF, so no big deal. The staff at this hotel were probably some of the best I have encountered in a while. They were genuinely nice and allowed us to check in 4 hrs early. They were also quick to ask us if we needed help finding restaurants etc. Location is great, 1 block from the BART station, great if you are arriving from SFO, or OAK. Cable car is also right down the street. Area was safe at all hours of the day, except for occasional panhandler but that is normal in every big city.Suggestions for guests would be to ask for an interior courtyard room as the exterior rooms face a nightclub and it can be noisy. If not ear plugs are readily available at the front desk.Overall this hotel is tops and I would stay here again if I am back in the city.",{"entities":[(154,166,"LOCATION"),(410,415,"HYGIENE"),(504,509,"PERSONNEL"),(725,733,"LOCATION"),(744,773,"LOCATION")]}),

Then when it was our turn, our room was not available (and should have been ready at 3pm). When we arrived back later to settle in for the evening at 9pm, there was again a 10 minute wait at the counter. They gave us a gift bag for our inconvenience. The wine in the gift bag turned out to be rotten or corked. Now this bordered on absurd. The room itself was fine. When I asked to speak to the manager on our way out in the morning the receptionist said that he was not available, but would email me. It was truly a terrible example of customer service.",{"entities":[(35,56,"PERSONNEL"),(491,495,"FURNITURE"),(584,596,"PERSONNEL"),(684,700,"PERSONNEL"),(542,549,"PERSONNEL")]}),
("We were charged for the first night of stay even though we were not in SF yet due to a sudden death in the family. In addition, the room we were given the next day was one of the smallest I've ever had, even though we had requested ahead of time to an upgrade. Told we didn't get the upgrade because we weren't there to check in. Throughout our four-night stay, one elevator was out of service and the other was very slow. We resorted to using the stairs to our third floor room. At checkout, we waited almost 15 minutes for an elevator because our luggage was too heavy to carry down the stairs. HOWEVER, for our final three nights we were upgraded to an Oasis Suite for no additional charge (beyond the night we were charged and didn't use). Very quiet, spacious room facing courtyard. Location is great for all SF tourist activities and shopping. Ate one night in the Italian restaurant. It was decent and the service was good. If check-in and the first night had been better, I'd give it a 5, but the poor first impression dropped the overall score. Hope both elevators are now functioning!",{"entities":[(8,15,"PERSONNEL"),(132,136,"FURNITURE"),(366,374,"FURNITURE"),(788,796,"LOCATION")]}),
("My husband, 4 year old, and I stayed at the Hotel Abri from Oct 11-14, 2012. The staff at this hotel were beyond 5 star with their service. They were helpful, honest, and really went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. My daughter was taken with Tyler at the front, in particular! Aside from the service, the boutique hotel was fine. We had an urban suite, which had ample room. The two window units kept the place cool, and the curtains kept out enough light. My only complaint, and I mean ONLY complaint, was that the bathroom door was a sliding door, did not lock, and was frosted glass. If you have kids, you know that sometimes your only solitude can come from the few moments you get in the bathroom. My daughter had a grand time putting her face up to the glass and letting us know she was well aware we were in there, and I am thankful she never realized she could actually open the door. My husband would probably say that he didn't care for the fact that sometimes during the day you could smell Subway from downstairs in our room (on the 2nd floor), but we weren't in there much, and it was minor. The hotel was very convenient to the cable car that took you to the Wharf, as well as the BART and other public transport. There was AMPLE shopping in the area too. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel, mainly to people traveling without small kids.

Ask for an inner room to avoid noise from the busy street outside.I visited SF about 5 years ago so was shocked at the amount of homeless people everywhere this time round.
