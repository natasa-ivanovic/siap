We were somewhat disappointed by the fact that rooms are on the lower half of the bldg, as the upper half is reserved for residents. The result is that the W just down the street, while not of the same caliber, has infinitely better views. So, ask for floors 14-20. Below that, it s just too low.Second point of criticism - and this applies to all St Regis butlers: they creep us out! These guys need to be less awkward / better trained / older than 15. Now, for the good stuff: Nice pool area, very good spa treatments, and a rather hopping and pleasant lobby bar. The Japanese restaurant was also rather on the nice side. The location is obviously fantastic, with SF Moma half a block away, and all the shops a couple of blocks away.Overall, a relaxing St Regis - not their best hotel, but definitely the best in San Francisco.",{"entities":[(114,119,"FURNITURE"),(622,631,"FURNITURE"),(708,727,"FOOD"),(766,774,"LOCATION")]}),

However, traffic getting into the hotel was a nightmare, partly due to Pride weekend when we were there, but in general it did take a long time to battle our way to the entrance every time we took the car out. Service was great at check-in, but when we asked for a kettle for the room and tea, it took about half an hour to arrive, with no tea bags. We don't generally enjoy the butler concept- when we asked for coffee, which was not available in the room like in other hotels, the butler charged us USD18. There was limited food options- a lobby restaurant/ bar and a second restaurant in the back. Food was extremely pricey. The pool was not something my kids wanted to use- a simple lap pool for adults. We are asked for the kids names and told the housekeeping would deliver something for them, but it didn't materialize, much to their disappointment.

Only complaint is cost of in room wi-fi access (this kind of hotel should have it complimentary) as well as breakfast arrangements - although waitress are helpfull and polite - 20 minutes to get eggs and croissiants is not acceptable (and also quote expensive)",{"entities":[(52,59,"LOCATION"),(171,180,"FURNITURE"),(218,223,"PERSONNEL"),(335,340,"HYGIENE"),(307,311,"FURNITURE"),(466,475,"FOOD"),(500,508,"PERSONNEL"),(553,557,"FOOD"),(562,573,"FOOD"),(608,617,"PRICE")]}),
("Recently stayed at the St. Regis at the beginning of July. Our stay at the hotel was amazing and it was made even better by the friendly staff. The concierge, Eric, was extremely helpful in recommendations of where to eat and also what wineries to visit. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Francisco.",{"entities":[(137,142,"PERSONNEL"),(148,157,"PERSONNEL"),(159,163,"PERSONNEL")]}),
("Very smartly located next to the Metreon and the conference center as well as the MOMA. If you are in town for a conference this is for you!If you are a tourist then this is not your best bet as this hotel sits two blocks South of Market St.Suites are very large and boast a dining room, a TV area with a large sofa, a separate bedroom and an expansive bathroom (separate toilets). Amenities are from Remde so top of the line. You will find those products in their Remde spa as well (located on the 6th floor).Gym + indoor pool.Metropolitan suites come with a 24/24 private butler service but expect a VERY slow service. If you order a bottle of champagne to treat your big clients in your suite expect to wait at least 30 min.No coffee maker, no tea kettle, nothing that you can make yourself. Each and every cup of coffee/tea must be ordered through the butler service and expect another long wait.No extra comforter, pillows.Summary: nice and large suites but service can definitely be improved.",{"entities":[(21,40,"LOCATION"),(290,292,"FURNITURE"),(311,315,"FURNITURE"),(574,580,"PERSONNEL"),(730,742,"FURNITURE")]}),
("What a wonderful hotel!!! 5 nights in a room with a great view over the Gardens with hills and sunset in the background. Service is over the top. I think St. Regis has figured out how to know what I want before I do. The food in the restaurants was very good. Concierge staff knew their stuff - great recommendations for places to walk, restaurants, etc. Surrounded by nice museums. We had a great stay",{"entities":[(40,44,"FURNITURE"),(58,79,"LOCATION"),(221,225,"FOOD"),(260,275,"PERSONNEL")]}),
("My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights because of the close proximity to Moscone Center, the art museum and great shopping, and of course because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. (How did we ever travel before Trip Advisor) Loved our time here. We requested and were given a quiet room - on the 17th floor. Everything about the St. Regis is stylish and modern (though not as great as the St. Regis in Manhattan). I loved the TV in the bathroom. Minor annoyances - the tv remote didn't work - probably dead batteries there was no price list for the overpriced wine in the wet bar - it took 20 minutes to have one sent up the electronic control center on the nightstand acted up a few times, turning the lights on in the middle of the night and I find it annoying to be charged extra for the wi-fi use (15/day). Regarding a couple comments posted earlier about the hallway carpeting, I loved it - a really fun design element. (will post a photo of it) We had the best meal of our stay in the hotel restaurant. The lap pool was warm and beautiful and empty - unfortunately I forgot my suit. Too bad the spa didn't have a basic suit to sell, like they do in some hotels. I would happily stay here again. By the way, San Francisco,what's up with the homeless people on your streets I've never seen so much panhandling and yelling and screaming and craziness and was actually afraid in some situations.",{"entities":[(57,90,"LOCATION"),(427,429,"FURNITURE"),(470,479,"FURNITURE"),(1018,1022,"FURNITURE")]}),
("As with any St. Regis, the level of service here is incredible. I had to stay for a few days for business earlier in the year and with a tight schedule, the hotel and comfort level of sleeping was really important to me.Rooms are very well designed. Bed is very comfortable. Staff attends to every and any need that you might have. I can't say enough good things about their attention to detail and customer service.",{"entities":[(250,253,"FURNITURE"),(275,280,"PERSONNEL"),(399,415,"PERSONNEL")]}),

The sushi bar is also a wonderful experience, talk about fresh and tending to your every wish.Super quick walk to Ferry terminal and Union Square.

("Astonishing with this hotel was the old building left in the middle of shopping centers, high buildings. The tram station was just outside as Wallgreens beside.HM and Macy's etc. What do you ask more for a perfect location I had probably the cheapest room, but it was just perfect. A bath tub to relax my pains. Breakfast wasn't included, but who needs that if there are a hundred places nearby to eat every hour of the day. Hop-on-off buses leave just 100m away. It was just sooo perfect. Early reservation is highly recommended",{"entities":[(61,87,"LOCATION"),(214,222,"LOCATION"),(284,292,"FURNITURE")]}),
("This the first time to San Francisco that I have not stayed in the area of Fisherman's Warf, and the Hotel Vertigo has changed my perspective of San Francisco. The Warf is a great area, but it is all tourists. When we go to SF, we like to walk (a lot) and visit the places the locals go. The Hotel Vertigo is in a great location for branching out all over the city. And, on those days when you just want to hang out - there are plenty of restaurants and bars within blocks. Hotel Vertigo is a seven story boutique hotel. Over the last couple of years I have made the decision to only stay in boutique hotels, and Hotel Vertigo does not disappoint. The rooms are small, but very well appointed. It is apparent that my room had recently been renovated with modern chic. The bathroom was huge with a great rain shower head. The room was on par with some of my recent stays in Madrid and Mexico City. Excellent WiFi coverage all over the hotel. My only complaint was that I had an inside corner room (709) on the 7th floor that adjoined another room. The door to the adjoining room was not very sound proof so I almost clearly heard TV and conversation in the next room. This was only a problem one night for about an hour before a fell to sleep after a long day of exploring the city. The staff here are amazing. They were always ready to help us with directions, taxis and recommendations. The rooms are cleaned very quickly each day with great detail. My friends have been staying at Hotel Vertigo for years and I'm glad they convinced me to stay here this time. I'll be back in a few months with my girlfriend and I know she will love the Hotel Vertigo.",{"entities":[(1286,1291,"PERSONNEL"),(652,657,"FURNITURE")]}),
