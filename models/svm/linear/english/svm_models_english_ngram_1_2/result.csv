1|-1|The hotel is clean, comfortable, cheap, has a small indoor/outdoor pool, large hot tub, provides extras like free breakfast, free dinner, free wi-fi, and free popcorn. The food wasn't great - a lot of mushy pasta at dinner - baked potatoes were good but
-1|-1|We stayed here after traveling through Rocky Mountain Nat'l Park. Not a chain motel. The room was small, but very clean. Very friendly staff. Bed was very comfortable. Room had a microwave and refrigerator. TV was low def (not HD). Wifi was spotty and somewhat slow. Continental breakfast was light - sweet rolls, donuts, muffins, coffee, cereal - no orange
-1|-1|accused of smoking in my room. only young black kids in the hotel. ima 24 year old well put together chef. needed time away with my girlfriend. Managers and loss prevention kept harassing us. Sunday morning knocked on my door and walked in without my consent and literally said oh i though you were smoking in here and walked out. I was hearing noise all night which i complained about, but nobody did anything about it: yet you're worried about if im smoking when your hotel is Loud and your staff is racist and rude because all of my greetings did not seem genuine. your loss prevention is not an army and i should sue for grievance. I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER. There were stains on my bed which i let go. my towels were not clean so i requested new ones. You service was so bad , and biased my girlfriend told me not to complain about the towels or buy from your marketplace. This is going to get solved in a court matter. This was the worst experience i have had at a hotel and i travel frequently.
-1|-1|The issues started the first night. Do Not stay in room 1501. Although the room seems like it is a bit away from the elevators the bed room is right next to the elevator shaft. This would be fine if it was just elevator noise but every time it went up and down the banged like the someone was knocking on the door loudly. All night all day whenever someone was in the elevator. I complained the first night to the front desk and actually a maintenance guy, Jared. He said that Otis elevator was actually on site fixing the elevators. They actually came to room but could not figure out where the noise was coming from. I did mention it again on Wednesday but they did not do anything. They could have at least moved me to another room. On Friday I was supposed to meet someone for dinner. I did not have his cell though. I had stepped out of the room for a bit, unfortunately right when he called at 630. He tried again at 7. The staff did not leave a message on my room phone (or my cell/email which they had). At 9 I received a call from the front desk that I received 2 calls at 630 and 7. When I asked why I am just hearing about it at 9, the woman said the note got lost and they had just found it. Oh did I say the pool was closed. Lastly, 1501 is a joined room and on Friday night, at 11 a family decided to have a fight where someone was slapped and the mother and little daughter started crying. I called the office but as far as I know no one came up or called. Just not a good stay.
-1|-1|Parking was horrible, somebody ran into my rental car while staying there. I didn't get to try the breakfast, I was there for business so the restaurant opened to late for the business world to enjoy, I had to asked for coffee for my room, And the items in the vending machine were stale.,
-1|-1|If you get the room that they advertised on the website and for what you paid, you may be lucky.If you stay many days , they will give you the not so good rooms.Nobody wants to stay in these rooms: low light/dark rooms, near pool, noisy, smelly bathrooms, or difficult access. If you stay one-two days you will get probably... ,
-1|-1|We recently stayed at this hotel on a trip to Lexington with other friends. Our group shared the feeling that we would not be back. We routinely waited more than 10 minutes for elevators. The workout room is tiny with 2 treadmills and 2 cheap elliptical machines that rocked off the floor when in use. Everything about the hotel seemed... ,
-1|-1|I reserved a room a week in advance, knowing a motel is usually not great accommodations but we were just passing thru during the longest yard sale. I was quoted 50 over the phone and given our room numbers as a confirmation number and she...
-1|-1|Hello, I have traveled a lot and abroad and by far this is the worst place i have ever booked. i paid got the key and walked in. OMG the place is HORRIBLE. this place is one of those hotels they show in horror movies where they kill people. I kid you not! this place is horrible. i only stayed...
-1|-1|This Hotel, formerly a prestigious bank, may be attractive for history buffs, but is an expensive and horrible place to stay when you visit New Orleans. The rooms are SMALL, unattractive, with terrible old bedding, virtually without windows or amenities. Parking was 38/day, and it took 35 min. to get your vehicle. Almost no lobby or sitting area, the restaurant was small, understaffed, with a severely limited menu. The commode was crammed into a tiny bathroom, and we had to call down to get them to bring up an old beat-up refrigerator. There are SO Many other more attractive places to stay in New Orleans, less expensive, I would avoid this place like the plague.
-1|-1|The Whitney Hotel is ideally located to see most of the sights of New Orleans. I would say it is a place to lay your head but I found the restaurant poor in terms of food choice and quality. The room phone did not work, no room service offered and the room can be noisy as it overlooks a major road. Overall, I think we can do better on my next trip to New Orleans
-1|-1|I will never consider staying at the Whitney after my epic night of uncomfortable room temperatures and a night's sleep on the hardest, cheapest mattress I've every experienced. The hotel staff was nonexistent and are complaints were only listened to AFTER check-out.,
-1|-1|The hotel was alright, this was my second stay at this hotel after my first experience I recieved a comp night to get a better experience. My second experience was about the same, rude staff, bugs in room, room wasn't cleaned when asked and many other things to add on this. For the price of the nights I did pay for, it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds.
-1|-1|Unfortunately, it is not a place to have confidence. One of my children left a small amount of money in the car. When we left the hotel we realized they had stolen it. Although it was little amount of money, the fact is equally repudiable.
-1|-1|My husband and I stayed for 4 nights with my 13 month old son and our experience was disappointing from the moment we checked in. When we made our reservation on the phone, we requested a crib for my son and were told it would be no problem. When we arrived we were shocked to see a pack-n-play rather than a crib and they didn't even provide us with a sheet. We called the front desk and demanded a crib. After a few hours, a crib was brought to our room... without even a crib sheet. After many phone calls to the front desk asking for a crib sheet we received a full size sheet for a crib. Apparently not a single person who worked there even knows what a crib sheet is. In addition to the crib and sheet fiasco, the carpeting in our suite was buckling and we almost tripped over it several times. There were also some sink holes in the bedroom. It seems that the hotel is about to undergo a much needed renovation, so hopefully they can also improve their customer service. The location of the hotel was the main reason we chose it, and it does have the potential to be a lovely boutique type hotel with some updates.
-1|-1|The staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. However, the hotel itself seemed to be a hodgepodge of various updates through the years. It seems staff has been trained to blame it on Katrina but when you stay its clear that the owner has not sufficiently maintained the facility through the years and when maintenance was performed, done so at the cheapest cost no matter how unsightly. the hotel has a lot of potential but is not a boutique by any stretch of the imagination. the windows are original so they are thin. curtains did not properly open and close. AC was loud and inconsistent at keeping a steady temp. using an old mercury thermostat. continental breakfast was paltry compared to others hotels
-1|-1|We booked this hotel as it offered close proximity to the the centre of New Orleans and it offered disabled facilities in 'superior' rooms. We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room
-1|-1|We have stayed at The Whitney before, but had no idea that the hotel no longer had a bar nor restaurant. This is a sad commentary, since we enjoyed the hotel last year, and were looking forward to another visit. The staff was again cooperative, understanding, and friendly. But, the sink had only a trickle for water flow, and the engineer could not fix the problem. And, we were there for 5 ngts.
-1|-1|The bar closed at 10pm which was poorOnly 3 days into our 8 day trip we were told the bar and Resturant were closed leaving us with no facilities in the hotel We should have been told that when we were booking and would not have booked it as it's nice to eat and drink in the hotel after a long days walking around town
-1|-1|The area was just off a busy freeway in what we described as the stripper neighborhood. I needed early checkin which I arranged months ago. Didn't get it. When we were able to check in noticed wet section if carpet. Thought maybe they cleaned something up. Next morning 1/4 room saturated. Went to front desk. They said probably Ac problem. They said no problem to fix. We left. 6 hours later returned problem not fixed and water is traveling. Went to front desk. They said something like this can't be fixed in a day. What did you expect Odd, I expected it fixed. Can you at least suck up the water No, we can't. Hmmmmm. You will get a new room. I said no, fix it. Our time is limited and on way out soon. They said they'd send someone to look at it. Twenty minutes in the bar (nice bar and staff) went up to room. Maintenance had it fixed in 5 minutes. They placed towels on floor where they stayed until we left.
-1|-1|Well checked in was given room 183 couldnt stand the odor for more then 5 seconds.went to desk got a different room 153 was much better but still odor of mildew and mold.was given free breakfast which was ok.i wouldn't recommend to anyone unless i wanted to know what they thought of the place.
1|-1|If you like King rooms, be prepared not to have a bath. None of their King rooms have baths, only showers. I could not properly wash my hair with a tiny showerhead. Many King rooms have communicating doors to the next room, which are good noise-carriers. With regard to noise: the rooms at the freeway end of the hotel are very noisy, much more so than other hotels we've stayed in on Hotel Circle South. We were living out of our suitcases because of the ridiculous size of the drawers in the room (basically the size of nightstand drawers - see picture). The pool is the size of a large hot-tub. Breakfast had many items but lacked quality: the only good things we found were yoghurt and fresh fruit, cooked food was poor.Hotel staff were helpful and did their best to resolve our issues in a not-so-great hotel. Next San Diego visit: back to the Doubletree.
-1|-1|I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around.,
1|-1|The hotel is nice, the location is good, and the staff has been nice BUT it is infested with little cockroaches and they are every where! It is disgusting! I would recommend spending a little more money for a hotel that won't have you sleeping and going home with nasty bugs!
-1|-1|The hotel is located next to a very noisy highway. The bathroom was very dirty and the room cooling/heating unit was very noisy. I was not made aware that there was a breakfast included so I could at least enjoy something from this hotel. I checked out after the first night of a 2 night stay and went to the Hilton Bayfront for almost the same money and a MUCH BETTER experience.
-1|-1|the restaurant was overpriced and not very good. The wall of mirrors in the rooms is awkward when you are sharing a room with your mother, although I think it would have been weird if it had been my husband and I too. The bottles of water in the room for 2.50 a bottle seemed a bit much since the next best western offered a complimentary bottle of water for their guests. With the price I paid for the room, for them to charge for water we thought it was ridiculous. Plus I stayed at a lot of hotels on this trip and this was the first one to charge a 75 dollar hold for the room in case we caused damages. We drove to san diego from Portland Or, because we couldnt afford to fly we had a credit card with just enough money on it for the room, which we had to get because my brother was graduating from Boot camp, and we had to scramble to find a card to put the money on which took out of our gas money. The king sized bed was actually a queen and the queen beds were double beds. There was hair in my bed the first night and part of a sticky note the second night. The shuttle driver the first night was kind of a jerk he made everyone get on the first shuttle so he didnt have to make a second trip so people were standing and crouching in the aisle and then he told everyone if they can drive they should so they dont have to be on the shuttle. Maui was a great driver but we did not like this other guy. I also had to get my key reactivated 3 times because it stopped working. I will be letting the Marine admins that recommend this hotel to visiting families about this stay.
-1|-1|We arrived at this hotel a little early for check in so we went to get some essentials from the supermarket. We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone.
1|-1|We stayed overnight in San Diego on our roadtrip. The Best Western is nice, cleen, there was a huge room with two queen size beds. There was free wifi and a refrigerator. We had a quite room on the ground floor.
-1|-1|This Hotel does not give you a welcoming feel, the staff is not friendly the rooms smell, beds are not comfortable. I stayed in a BW in North Hollywood the same week and it had breakfast and did not smell very nice.
1|-1|I have come to except a certain level of Respect and Professionalism with Best Western Properties, but this one falls below the mark, they have no respect for their Diamond Level customers, the food at the Restaurant is over Priced for what you receive. There is no free or Discounted Breakfast, and no real incentive to eat Lunch or Dinner on property. the Internet works great, Beautiful Property and Housekeeping staff are very nice and courteous.
-1|-1|This was a terrible experience our room had nats and spiders in it. It smelled and the Air conditioned was filthy and did not work. It was disgusting and in need of renovation. I needed a new room and they did not want to accommodate me wanted to send maintenance, No way I already was late for our tour. After about 40 minutes they sent the manager who was absent every time I asked for him. And of course no one could help except him. He finally offered a new old room that smelled but the ac work. We had to move and of course had no time to get ready for our 515 tour. I will be contacting the hotel management to discuss this overpriced horrible experience not the local manager he never called me he didn't like me much after I told the folks checking in check their rooms for bugs!,
-1|-1|Gnats in room, I had bites all over my body and due to spraying of raid had a severe chemical reaction to my lungs. The walk ways should have been posted slippery due to sprinkler, someone could have had a serious fall. Table by pool area filthy. Mgr Scott was rude regarding my situation!!!! Will not recommend!!!! Food prices in hotel very high.
-1|-1|Awful hotel. Low quality for the price. Service was horrible, good luck trying to contact a manager to help solve really simple problems with your stay. The room I stayed in has terrible ventilation and low quality bed, sheets, towels, etc. I am most peeved by the service and wish I could say I had a better experience.,
-1|-1|The place was good, but upon checkout I was told they would apply my 40.00 gift card plus an email of my check out. Neither happened. The location is central and the room is good. We had a patio. The staff was not very helpful. The location is on hotel row with 20 other hotels you could chose from. You might try Hampton Inn or one of the others. It is right by the freeway.,
-1|-1|Warning:. Do not stay here if you have kids or simply don't mind having others watch you in your room through peepholes. Oct 13th to 16th stay. Peephole discovered above light, which is above sink in room 507. Sheriff's Dept. Notified at 830 am next morning. Staff didn't care and in fact smirked as though they didn't believe it. Corporate responded by email to my complaint stating that since credit card company agreed to reverse charges and police had been contacted, they weren't going to pursue matter, implying somehow that I shouldn't have told in them. Absolutely gross! You have been warned! Stay at own risk! I will update further once the police investigation has completed. Check out the pics of the room, 507. Attached.,
-1|-1|Not what we were expecting from a Best Western. Stayed here with my family of 4 because it was near the zoo and was expecting better from a Best Western. Room with 2 double beds was extremely small, hotel was quite dated and we felt uncomfortable. Thought we could get a roll-away bed with our room but they said it would not fit, They were correctm we could barely move in this tiny, tiny room! Will not stay here again.
-1|-1|my name is stephanie me and my boyfrien booked this hotel for 4 days i woke up to a silver fish in my bed in top of my arm this mornin january 6 2012 to my luck on my birthday i have a rash in my leg i found 2 of them ... i understand they are bugs but to find them in my bed thats not goood .. i placed them in a container and walk to the front dest i told the front desk girl and she said it was just like a spider .. are u kidding me i cant belive she just said that im very upset i would understad if i would of found them in the bathroom floor or else were buut no it had to be in my bed :( i reserch them and it falls in the bed bugs list ...... the phone dident work they wount even let u reheat your food .... the dinner food is grosse and expensive not a good place to stay in .
-1|-1|I will start with the major issue. This Best Western has no staff that reads of que. It is almost as if they are responding by a written list, like a customer support rep from India would. They repeat the same answer over and over rather than trying to listen to you and work on something. I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets. The hotel itself was nice, but there were just so many big errors. I will never stay at this hotel again.
-1|-1|On a good note, this place has nice hot water, the AC keeps the room nice and cold, the staff are helpful, room service seemed to be very efficient, the beds are comfortable enough, and the one meal I had here was pretty good.On the flip side, our room had bugs (most likely due to the gaping crack around the door), a lot of the outlets did not work, the tub always looked like it had sand in the bottom, and the carpeting looks like it is in bad need of replacement.Solely based on my experience, I cannot recommend this place to anyone.,
-1|-1|bad sound insulation, housekeeping sucks, the new stuff that we bought got throw away... yogurt been spill on the floor
-1|-1|Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible!
-1|-1|I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs.
-1|-1|Bed is too small for two people and the blanket is too thin. The staff are just ok not very friendly though
-1|-1|Bed was a bit hard. Breakfast was all carbs, but was better than nothing.
-1|-1|Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal.
-1|-1|breakfast could be improved.
-1|-1|Breakfast is poor.
-1|-1|the omelets were watery and tasted odd and the pool was small.
-1|-1|The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally.
-1|-1|The only issue I had was there not being a microwave/refrigerator in the room.
-1|-1|assigned an accessible room without being told. tried to book room direct with hotel but was told tat they could not match thebooking.com rate (even though we were starwood members.. ).
-1|-1|Second year I have stayed at this hotel. I have business in the area and it is convenient for me. Morning free breakfast is very good, hot, fresh and a large selection. Typical motel setting with free parking. Bed was very comfortable. I wasn't happy with the cleanliness this visit. My white socks were pretty dirty after walking around in the room. On check out I told them of 2 issues I felt needed to be resolved. They made a note of that. 2nd day, I returned to my room at 10 p.m. and housekeeping didn't freshen my room. Upon checkout I told the Front Desk, and they said, If you have a Do Not Disturb sign on your door at 9 a.m., they by-pass your room and don't come back. When I told them I removed the sign at 10:15 a.m. when I went to work for the day, Front Desk basically said, that's their policy. I find that policy totally inconsiderate. Next time in the area, I will seek another hotel.
1|1|Stay at The Whitney to capture a sense of the historry of New Orleans with its actual bank vault door decor, and location that is right in the heart of New Orleans great for business but close to the French Quarter for fun. It's clean, comfortable, has amenities, and is a great location, friendly too.
-1|1|Overall, good trip. Clean and friendly! It was mid summer when we stayed and we prefer ice cold room. Couldn't get it cool enough. Bed was comfy. Pillows a bit too thick for us. Cold water at faucet was warm to hot. Shower temp was perfectly hot. Would recommend more mirrors in room. A safe would be good addition and fridge. Enjoyed continental breakfast. Would stay at this beautiful hotel again.,
-1|1|Our recent stay at the Whitney was overwhelmingly nice. The hotel is housed in the historic old Whitney Bank Building. The reception desk was once the teller desk and the old vault is located in the lobby. Our suite was very large with two rooms. The master bedroom was quite spacious and was separated from the sitting area by French doors. The sitting area had a sofa bed it's own television. The bathroom was also very spacious. The hotel offers free internet as well as complimentary coffee. There is a restaurant located in the lobby. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel is located right off of Saint Charles Avenue which is very convenient during Mardi Gras and only a half a mile from the French Quarter. I will be staying again!!!
-1|1|I have stayed at the Whitney many times for business, back when it was a Wyndham property and now that it is a New Orleans Collection Hotel. Staff is friendly and efficient, rooms are clean. At some point soon they will need to address carpet as it is getting dated, but OK now. Bar downstairs is good as is restaurant. We ate breakfast a couple of times at Cafe on the Square around the corner and had good experiences.
1|1|We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at The Whitney. The beds were very comfortable. The location is superb. It is walking distance to everything we did, French Quarter, Bourbon Street, shopping, Harrah's, etc. We will definitely stay here during our next trip to New Orleans. The staff was rather gracious as well. Loved it!!!!
1|1|Super friendly and accommodating staff. Staff bent over backwards to assure we had a great stay. Always ice cold water, news papers and vacation information in the lobby. Great restaurant recommendations. We ubered from the airport 33-55 . You do not need a car in the city. Street car on one side of hotel. 2 blocks to French quarter and bourbon street. Near casino and ww2 museum. Beds super comfortable and hotel is really clean.,
1|1|We enjoyed the hotel. Location was great walking distance to many sites. Paying to park was a surprise, but we decided that was better than staying further away and worrying about parking.Hotel was absolutely beautiful. Very nicely maintained. No old hotel odor. Staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was nice, very comfortable kept very clean by friendly housekeeping staff. Lovely city view. Traffic noise was noticeable. Bathroom was good sized, had a great shower, and was nicely kept. Restaurant was beautiful. Food adequate but not exceptional. Limited hours. Service friendly but I actually got up to get my own coffee refills one morning even though only two tables had customers. Overall a great experience and we would definitely stay again and recommend it to others.,
-1|1|on the edge of the french quarter, easy access, courteous service, efficient, clean, valet parking, personalized welcome, correct price. Not for a romantic stay but perfectly fine for business or family stay,
-1|1|I found this hotel online, and it came highly recommended. It was convenient to everywhere in the city I wanted to go, though its location on Poydras street did mean the mornings were a little noisier than I expected due to the traffic, but you can't fault them for that. I had occasional difficulty with my room key working but still always got into my room. I didn't realize at booking that the hotel doesn't have a bar/restaurant and the room didn't have a refrigerator but that was my fault for not checking. Overall the staff was incredibly helpful, friendly, and made my stay. The hotel is very unique and original due to its history and not like every out-of-the-box hotel you find these days. It was nice to stay in a place with such character.
1|1|We had a wonderful stay at the Whitney hotel. The front desk staff headed by Patrick were the best that I have ever experienced. They were extremely helpful in making reservations at great restaurants, guided us through the craziness of Mardi Gras and were always friendly and helpful in every way. The rates were a good value and the location was ideal.,
-1|1|Spontaneous weekend getaway. Estes Park Condos did not disappoint. This place is even more magical than the website makes it seem! Staff was very accommodating with our late check in and check out. We stayed at Antlers Point 5, private hot tub, grill, fireplace, HBO, dvd player, full bathroom and full kitchen. Very cozy and welcoming. Perfect for a couple
-1|1|I and my wife stayed here with two other couples. we had a loft, a queen bed, Another bedroom and a queen sleeper sofa in the living room. All areas had TV's. The condo overlooked the big Thompson river. you could here the river running at night. Very clean and everything is very nice .. all services worked..
-1|1|We rented a premium condo 2 bedroom hot tub to spend a weekend with our friends that were visiting us in Colorado from another country. The place was nice and clean,very spacious for the four of us. One bedroom was in the main floor with a full bathroom.( not inside the room). The second room was in the second floor,
-1|1|We only stayed one night but were pleased that the room was clean and quite. Bed was comfortable and the breakfast was good. The staff we encountered were all friendly. Had a good small town friendly atmosphere.
-1|1|Hampton Inn was, as usual, clean, staff was friendly. Breakfast was adequate. We had stayed at this facility approximately 3 years ago and found that it hasn't changed. Still a nice place to visit. Staff very willing to make any change to keep customer happy.
-1|1|Stayed 2 nights. Nice big room, very quiet room! Was on top floor. They have a happy hour from 5:30pm to 7 pm. Lots of food more like dinner than hor'd'ors. Drinks food, free popcorn and fountain drinks. NICE HOT breakfast
1|1|Our family of five spent two nights here on our way back to MO from UT. Beds were comfortable, bathroom was clean, breakfast and dinner menu were great. Pool and hot tub were clean and well maintained. Staff was friendly and attentive.
-1|1|We stayed one what was a shame. When we checked in we spoke to Ian on desk this man was so helpful. We had free dinner. Three drinks free. Also free soft drinks. The hotel is so good. The spa and pool. Excellent.
1|1|We stayed in a king bed suite here while settling on our home in Colorado Springs. It was nice to have a spacious living area (with sofa bed for our son) and comfortable, quiet bedroom. ,
1|1|Another great trip at the Drury Inn. Clean and nice rooms and common areas. All of the female staff were very nice and friendly. Indoor pool and hot tub. Kickback is a nice feature. Great snacks/food in the evening: hot dogs, nachos, chicken fingers, salad
1|1|Clean, spacious, and quiet rooms. Very comfortable accommodations. Breakfast was good for a free buffet style breakfast. I will stay here again. I will also recommend this hotel to friends. This is in a good location to take in the sites around the area.
1|1|The lobby is large and beautifully decorated. The desk staff friendly. The room is well appointed with a great bed and pillows. The bathroom is great really loved the soft towels and the walk into shower with wall dispensers for soap, shampoo and conditioner,
1|1|Drury Inn Suites near the AF Academy is a GEM!! The staff is SUPER friendly! So are the rooms!The Breakfast is SUPER great variety - and so is the EVENING FEAST! and INCLUSIVE LIQUIDS!!!
-1|1|Our organization arranged for our out-of-town Board members to stay at Drury Inn Suites for a Board Meeting, which we also held in one of the Drury Conference Rooms. The management and staff of the Drury Inn provided excellent service and accommodations,
1|1|Our stay was great at the Drury Inn. Stayed on the 7th floor in a king deluxe. The staff were all very nice and courteous. The breakfast was good as well. Also offered free food and drinks from 530pm-7pm. The Hearty Chili was very good.
-1|1|We stayed at the Drury Inn and Suites Colorado Springs for one night. We specifically chose the Drury Inn chain due to a good experience at the Drury Inn Denver Tech Center last summer. We were not disappointed. The hotel was clean, modern,
1|1|We were introduced to Drury Hotels by an acquaintance. Now we stay everywhere that has one on our trip route. Colorado Springs is a good example of the best of the best. It is beyond clean the staff are helpful, friendly, and polite.
-1|1|First, this was the first time I have ever stayed at a Drury Inn, and I am here to say it was absolutely the best choice I made for this trip. It was within 7 minutes of where I needed to be, it is clean
1|1|This hotel has a great view of Pikes Peak. It's right up there with the rest of the Drury Hotels. Very clean. Friendly staff. There are a lot of restaurant options nearby. Unfortunately for me most of them are restaurants I have in my hometown.
-1|1|This is a great hotel! Our first time staying at a Drury Inn but definitely won't be our last! The Hotel was in great condition. My kids loved the indoor/outdoor pool and the hot tub. The happy hour was amazing and had so much food
-1|1|From the moment we checked in until we left two days later we had excellent service from everyone. Our room on the fifth floor had amazing views over the mountains. The room was very clean and everywhere in the hotel was clean and tidy. Brian
-1|1|This is a new location and staff is friendly and attentive. I know what I'll get each time I stay and that is a good stay in a nice room. Food for breakfast and evening happy hour is good. This place is always clean
-1|1|We have never stayed here before but decided to give it a try based on the reviews we read. The staff was amazing. The room is bright, clean, and comfortable. The free breakfast and happy hour, along with the popcorn was a bonus and helpful
1|1|I booked our room the night before we stayed after reading the reviews. Although it seemed a little pricey, it was the best price in the area for the busy season. We came after a day at RMNP. Great location, not in the middle of busy downtown Estes Park but close if you want to enjoy the town.
1|1|nice clean hotel. Near WIU campus. Front desk very helpful, after traveling all day able to check into our room early. Rooms very clean Breakfast was nice, hot and plentiful not far from stores and places to eat dinner
1|1|My daughter and I stayed at the Hampton Inn during a visit to WIU for Audition Day! Perfect Experience! Comfy, clean beds with fluffy comforters and great pillows. Totally updated bathroom with fine finishes. Breakfast was awesome and the dining area was so nice. We will be back again,
1|1|Room was very clean and well appointed. Everything you need for an extended stay. Bed was very comfy. Front desk was extremely accommodating. I had a very late check-in due to another engagement and there was no issue. Highly recommend.
-1|1|We were at the Club Pulse for just one night. Everything was perfect, staff at the front desk were very friendly and knowledgeable, everyone we ran into was professional and nice, the room was super comfy. We had a suite with a kitchenette (microwave, refrig with freezer unit, coffee maker, dishes, flatware, glasses for water and wine), 2 televisions - one in the bedroom the other in the living room. The seating was very comfortable and a table to eat. I highly recommend this property. We were in town to see the play Hamilton, we were easily able to walk to the Gas Lamp for dinner and then to the Civic Theater.
1|1|My wife and I stayed this past weekend at the Marriott Pulse. Nice hotel with great amenities. Good location in downtown San Diego. Only 4 blocks to the gaslamp district with many choices of restaurants in the area. 1 bedroom unit is a little small compared to other Vacation Club properties so would be tight if 4 are staying in one of these units.
-1|1|We ended our San Diego stay here, with 4 nights. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was comfortable, and, surprisingly, the pull out sofa bed was the most comfortable I have slept on. The fitness center was clean, and had a good variety of equipment. The parking fee is steep, but standard for a large city. Good luck going around the spiral getting in and out of the garage. Easy access to everywhere we needed to go.
1|1|Stayed here September 2018 for 7 nights hotel was amazing and should be rated a 5 star plus everything was perfect fantastic rooms amazing staff first class facilities great location close to all local attractions would highly recommend.
1|1|My wife and I stayed here with our 2 grandchildren for 5 days in April. The room amenities are very nice with very comfortable bedding and living area. The Kitchen area is small, however, with a small mini refrigerator and microwave so if you are planning to eat many meals in your room, this is not the hotel for that. We walked to Little Italy, the Gas Lamp area, PETCO Park and to the USS Midway. Very convenient to all locations. They have Valet parking and a restaurant on property although we did not use it. They also have a fitness area and a indoor pool.Steve, thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you and your family enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego. We hope you will visit us again sometime.
1|1|This place was recently renovated and our room on the 23th floor felt like we were staying in a hi-end condo with breathtaking views of San Diego bay and the Coronado bridge. Sleek and modern decor with marble countertops stood out to me. There were two flat screen TV's, and a fully-stocked mini kitchen with fridge. Located right in the middle of downtown minutes away from the gas lamp district this place is prime location. The luxurious amenities combined with meticulous customer service especially in the downstairs restaurant makes for a memorable experience that I wouldn't hesitate to highly reccommend over and over again! Great job Marriott!,
1|1|I stayed at the Marriott Vacation Club Pulse during Memorial Day weekend from the Bay Area. Unfortunately, I had pulled my hamstring prior to my arrival and was in extreme pain after walking through 2 airports and pulling my luggage. The hotel staff took me to my room in a wheelchair and brought me ice and other items to assist with my pain. On top of that, they gave me a Get Well card signed by all the staff. The room is nice (not too big and not too small) and the furniture is well appointed. The bathroom is a really great size with the closets located inside the restroom along the wall (nice touch). Before I arrived I read the reviews where other travelers complained about a reflection on the sliding door that separates the living room from the bedroom at night. I did not experience that. I enjoyed the indoor pool/jacuzzi and the close proximity to the Donut Bar (the donuts are splendid), the House of Blues, as well as other restaurants, banks and stores. The street it is located on is more quaint than lively, but you're a stone's throw away from the action. The room service is great ( I ordered breakfast a couple of mornings) as well and the delivery team makes sure you're satisfied. They also have a discount card avail (not sure it's available to all traveler profiles) that you can use at nearby restaurants which was a plus. I really enjoyed this property which I will definitely book when I return to the San Diego area.
1|1|This is a really modern hotel bang, smack in the centre of the great city of San Diego, California. And because it has most of anything you need at pretty high quality, it is not cheap. We stayed for two days and enjoyed both beertasting and whiskey/whiskytasting for only 5 each. The bartenders, John and Ben, did a fine job! Breakfast is not included, but it's not very expensive and you have lots of choices. We didn't try the restaurant. They served us good hashbrowns and perfect eggs which were impressively fast on our table. Good selection of teas and real freshly squeezed orangejuice. Staff looks happy, not just polite. Great room, loved the chocolate! Fine beds, fridge and microwave in the livingroom and tv both there and in the bedroom. Modern fascilities for charging phones etc. Even if you need an extra plug, it's already there. Any niggles Well, parking in cities may be difficult, but 42 per night with valet and 35 without seems to me a bit over the top, the room comes at a price so it ought to be half the price for guests. After all, just a few blocks up you could park for free on the street. But will I stay there again if in SD Yes, of course.
1|1|Stayed here for one night and really enjoyed it. The place is very modern and is being upgraded. The staff couldn't have been any nicer. Great bar with pretty good bar food.The bar tenders were super. Place was very clean. The only problem is you're a little removed from the action but a short Uber/Lyft ride and you're there.Worth going back to next time I'm in San DIego.
-1|1|My husband has business here and I tagged along. What a fantastic hotel. The service is impeccable. When we checked in I had bruised my wrist, freak accident. My husband asked for an ice pad. They gave us 2 ice pads and was so concern. We checked into our awesome and perfect suite, not 5 minutes. We heard a knock on the door. Anthony, security management, was at the door with a note of well wishes for me plus a box of gourmet cookies. We were just blown away how fabulous his concern was for us as their guests. We can't say enough how awesome the service is for this hotel. Highly recommended. Wish I could give it a 6 stars. :),
1|1|We got a couple of connecting suites, very confortable and with all the necesary ammenities. Stayed there for a week. Contemporary and stylish.What we liked the most was the location right in the middle of down town where there is a good array of restaurants, its close to the Glass Lamp area and to the trolley.Service was very kind at all times. The food was ok but for some reason lacking a bit in salt to our latino taste buds. But the coffee great. Restaurant open at all times which is practical.One thing that should be handled is the dirty windows from the outside. That takes away from the aesthetics.I definitely give it a thumbs up because its a good value for the money.It sounds like the perfect vacation at Marriott Vacation Club Pulse!
-1|1|Not cheap but excellent location. Price is somewhat standard for not hacing reservations. But room was nice and clean. They offer good continental breakfast which is a plus and compensates. Front desk service and personnel where excellent. It is Carmel, no A/C in rooms but they have a fan for air circulation.,
-1|1|This is such a fun, lovely hotel. The attention to detail is impressive, from the thicker rimmed water glasses to the extra fluffy towels. Loved the vibrant art which lends itself to a hip vibe. My only disappointment was at their restaurant, the Lockbox. The menu is just trying too hard. I am a fairly adventurous eater but each of... ,
-1|1|This is a new Hampton Inn and is well decorated. The color scheme gives a feeling of luxury and is very restful. The beds are comfortable and the black out curtains keep the room dark for a good nights sleep. The entrance is a little difficult to find so look closely for the sign. The staff was very friendly and... ,
-1|1|Completely accommodating hotel! I booked a reservation last minute day of, used points to offset the cost and even called the front desk to ask for a little help. They were completely kind and welcoming, especially accommodating while under construction. Thank you!
